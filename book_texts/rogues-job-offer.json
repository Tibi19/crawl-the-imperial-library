        "Don't be alarmed, but I've been following you. You might say I'm a fan of your work. But I also don't like doing business in person, so I slipped you this letter while you slept. Consider this job my apology for messing with your beauty rest.",

        "The mark's a fat, milk-drinking noble who just arrived in Markarth. He's got one of those fancy High Elf names, Cuinanthil. Don't try to pronounce it, you'll just give yourself a headache.",

        "Point is, he's so rich if you poke him he'll spit gems out his mouth. And I know for a fact he's stashed a large portion of his wealth in a vault somewhere in the Reach.",

        "First, take this vial and spike some sujamma at a cookpot, so the heat activates the poison. As for the sujamma itself, you can probably get a bottle on Solstheim, if none of the traders around here have it. A bit out of the way, but worth it.",
        "",
        "Once the sujamma's spiked, convince the innkeeper at the Silver-Blood Inn to sell it. When the two stop by the inn, the drink will turn the Dunmer's insides out, and keep him at the bar for a good long while.",

        "Once the bodyguard's out of the way, you'll be free to pick the other one's pockets. Take whatever you like, but what I need is his personal ring seal, the one he uses for letters.",
