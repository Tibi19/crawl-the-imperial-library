As you know, the Pig-Men have been migrating in greater numbers recently. This may be the beginning of a new settlement. We cannot afford to stand idly by and give them time to dig in.",
        "Sergeant Malene has been interrogating the Orcs we captured in last week's raid. Apparently there is some discord among their savage tribes\u2014something of a leadership dispute. If any of these beasts plan to return to the city, we must be prepared to go to war. We cannot suffer the Orcs to stack stones. The Oath demands that we act!",
