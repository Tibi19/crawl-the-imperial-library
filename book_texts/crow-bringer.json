        "Crow Bringer was said to possess the powers of the Hagravens, allowing him to transform into a murder of crows and attack his foes from a hundred directions at once. It was perhaps inevitable that his reign as Champion would be cut short by one who utilized the powers of light. When Crow Bringer used his transformation powers against Hagrof the Righteous, a blinding light incinerated the crow forms, leaving nothing in their place but the Brimstone Crown itself.",
