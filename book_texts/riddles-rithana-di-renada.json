        "Down in a grave where Dremora crawl\nTwo left, two right, three vases above\nRimmen's legacy awaits",
        "Deep in a shameful abode\nWatched over by a golden flower\nRiverhold sits patiently",
        "East of a starry haven\nAtop a hill, beneath stone arch\nDune is shaded from the sky",
        "Beneath the ground, atop a mesa\nBetween white bones and chest of treasure\nVerkarth has been tucked away",
        "Prowl for a shard of the sky\nLook west to the hidden crevice\nMeirval waits by lantern bright",
        "On the path west of Merryvale\nPast hanging bridge, up stone stairs\nPellitine waits between twin flame",
        "Where the desert sands sweep ruins\nAnd the fanged necromancer prowls\nAt the edge of a scar shines Alabaster",
        "At the center of a jungle's tangle\nA pillar stands, a pillar falls\nAnd Bruk'ra soaks in cool waters",
        "In the smoldering embers\nOf its ruined city\nOrcest lies shaded by stone shrine",
        "Scars weep for Corinth\nBetween two twisting trees\nWhere savannah grasses grow",
        "West of the Stitches, in canyon brown\nFour pillars form together\nWith Helkarn at their center",
        "High above a scar of ash\nShaded by a lone tent\nSenchal hides from creeping dead",
        "A stone Khajiit guards Tenmar\nAs she worships dual Moons\nWithin the temple's courtyard",
        "Torval sits in hollowed stump\nBy the spring of Arkay's lash\nA nereid guards its murky waters",
        "On the outskirts of Rimmen, by rebel's camp\nRuins sit crooked atop a hill\nKhenarthi waits within them"
