        "We all remember Annine Praul,\nWent out to sea one day;\nIthguleior bit off her head,\nBeneath the sea of gra-ay, beneath the sea of gray!\nAnd what about Therese's son,\nA brave and handsome boy;\nIthguleoir has et him up,\nHis mother's pride and jo-oy, his mother's pride and joy!\nOh how we mourn our goodman Thom,\nWho swore he'd catch the beast;\nIthguleoir et him whole,\nAnd then he ate the pri-iest, and then he ate the priest!"
