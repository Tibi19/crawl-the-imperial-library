        "We've gotten numerous reports of disturbances in the graveyard area next to the temple and we'd like you to investigate. The reports describe strange noises, described as \"stone grating on stone\" and shadowy figures moving about the mausoleum. I've sent a guard to investigate, but they've come up empty-handed. We've already spoken to Alessandra, but she assures me that these odd reports have nothing to do with any rituals of Arkay she might be performing. Any help you could render would certainly be appreciated.",
