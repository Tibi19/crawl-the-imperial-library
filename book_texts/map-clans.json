        "For most of its history, the Orsimer people have shunned written records and relied on oral traditions. But one early Orc scholar, Thugbo gro-Thutt, collected the oral tradition in the celebrated volume, \"History of the 13 Clans.\" Though the original manuscript was lost and probably destroyed (not every clan agreed with Thugbo's account of origins and territory), the map depicting the locations of the first strongholds survived.",
        "Worn by time and stained with water, ale, and blood, Thugbo's Map of Clans indicates where he believed each of the 13 clans established their homes at the end of the Dawn Era. It only survived because it somehow found its way into a Breton museum. King Kurog purchased the map, but the courier never arrived."
