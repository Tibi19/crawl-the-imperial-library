        "(Battle Chant of the Intrepid Two Hundred)\nWe are dragon knights. We are dragons.\nIf you attack us, you will meet talons.\nIf you strike us, you will eat spikes.\nIf you injure us, our wounds will close.\nIf you anger us, you will burn.\nIf you run from us, we will pounce upon you.\nYou cannot win. We cannot lose.\nWe are dragon knights. We are dragons."
