        "I never told Maurice. I was waiting to surprise him, after the family accepted our love and blessed our union. But that never happened. And Maurice never found out about our baby.",
        "Now he'll never know. I can't believe what a coward he turned out to be. He couldn't stand up to his mother, not even to save the life of the woman he loved. Instead, he didn't say a word and left me in this tower to rot. I never should have trusted a Baelborne.",
        "I thought about calling the guards and telling them the truth. But I don't want my child to grow up to be a Baelborne. I won't allow that.",
        "I'm dying. I pray to any who hear my plea. I don't expect an answer, but I want our deaths to be avenged. Somehow, someway, I'll make the Baelbornes pay."
