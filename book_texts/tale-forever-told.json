        "The Silvenar walked with eyes open across Valenwood. His heart, torn from its primal aspects, was an empty pit.",
        "From the wild came a Bosmer unlike any other. Her eyes were of fire, hair of wind and rain, and all who gazed upon her quaked in fear. All except the Silvenar.",
        "Though she bared her fangs, he did not shy away. Though she sought to lose him in the underbrush, the vines parted for him to follow. She growled, filled with confused desires, wishing both to stay, and to leave.",
        "In a bright clearing, she faced the Silvenar, and ripped at him with claws and teeth. Though he fended off her blows, still his blood soaked into the grass and the flowers wept. Her rage spent, the Green Lady finally stepped back and addressed the Silvenar.",
        "\"Why do you follow me? You are not one of us!\" She spat upon the ground, her fists still clenched, stained with his blood.",
        "\"But I am of you,\" the Silvenar said quietly. \"Come, let me open your eyes to the green singing.\"",
        "Curious, the Green Lady came to the Silvenar. Long did they stare unspeaking, until they warmed to union. The forest shuddered as spirit and body became one.",
        "With his touch, she saw the dance of frond and leaf, and learned the ways and wiles of Valenwood. His emptiness filled with her passion, and his nameless longing waned.",
        "Their union both tamed the wild and invigorated the greenery."
