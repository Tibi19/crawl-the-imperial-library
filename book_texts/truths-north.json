        "When the snow fades\nand the rivers run fat,\nThe sun sits like a flower\non a young boy's hat.\nThe wise Nord knows\nit can never last.\nHe enjoys the day,\nthough it travels fast.\nWhen the snow is gone,\nand rivers run dry,\nThe sun beats down\nlike an angry eye.\nThe wise Nord knows,\nthough the day is long,\nThese are the days,\nhe is hale and strong,\ngrowing like a seed\nfrom the fresh spring soil.\nWhen frost returns\nand the rivers choke,\nThe sun dips in the sky\nbeneath evening smoke.\nThe wise Nord knows\nthough his strength may fade,\nIt is time to plan,\nand time to save.",
