        "Every sailor has their charms to help keep them afloat on the uncaring sea. I've seen a sailor wear a lock of his lover's hair around his neck to keep his head above water and I always tie my ropes starboard-side first. But those twisted idols and barnacle-crusted books have no place on a sane person's ship. Not that a sane person could keep a fleet of cutthroats under his heel. He's never lead us astray so far, so I suppose we just have to trust that the Commodore's luck hasn't run its course."
