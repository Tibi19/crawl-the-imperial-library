        "Want to show your love and faith for Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, but you're not ready to devote yourself to the Akatosh priesthood? The Cathedral of Kvatch understands. That's why we've established the Society of the Dragon.",
        "Led by the Grand Chanter Surus and a select few Akatosh priests, the Society welcomes initiates into its ranks for fellowship, learning, and to discuss the most-pressing theological questions of the day. Come join the Society. Help us make Kvatch a better place through prayer, faith, and your devotion to Akatosh.",
        "All serious inquiries accepted. We have a place for you as part of the Society."
