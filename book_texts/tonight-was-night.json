        "Tonight was the night, and it was as amazing as I had imagined it would be. It was inevitable, I suppose. Fate.",
        "My handsome, pale stranger. We met. We touched. His hands were so cold. Deathly cold. For a moment, I almost pulled away. But only for a moment. Then I moved closer, drinking in his sunken cheeks, his pale complexion, his icy lips.",
        "Were the shivers that cascaded down my spine from the cold, or from the perverse excitement he arouses in me?",
        "All I know is that tonight confirmed what I've been trying to deny all this time: I belong to him."
