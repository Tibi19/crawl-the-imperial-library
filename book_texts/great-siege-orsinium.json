        "Ra Gada fought the tusky folk\nFrom Hammerfell they drove them\nIn wrath withdrew they northward to\nOrsinium, Orc city\nWhere found they welcome at the hands\nOf King Atop the Scarpment,\nGolkarr, mighty, Orc of wiles\nWho thought to take advantage\nTo use infusion of new blood\nTo broaden Orcish holdings\nDemands he made of Bretons south\nAlong the Bjoulsae River\nFor tariffs, tolls, ransoms, fees,\nOr down would come Orc hammer\nBut Joile, the king in Daggerfall\nRejected Golkarr's dictum\nSent to Gaiden Shinji of\nThe Order of Diagna\nUrged him with the Bretons join\nTo siege and sack Orc city\nMarched they then to Wrothgar Scarp\nOrsinium invested\nThey thought that Orcish walls could not\nWithstand their worthy weapons\nBut city high upon the scarp\nWas triple-gate defended\nObdurate Gates: each one greater\nThan the one before it\nSmelter, Hammer, Temper, they\nWere called, by Orcish stonewrights\nThe folk of Mauloch stood atop\nAnd hurled down baneful missiles\nAnd Breton, Redguard, smitten sore\nDrew back to lower regions\nLaughed then the Orcs, and bared their tusks\nAt warrior Men confounded\nWhile Golkarr smiled in high Scarp Keep\nAnd praised the Wrothgar clan-kin\nBut Gaiden Shinji and King Joile\nWere not abashed or shaken\nThey summoned grandees, knights, and counts\nTo bring their armsmen thither\nOrsinium surrounded they\nAnd settled in to siege it\nWhile plots and plans were schemed and made\nThe walls and gates, to breach them\nThe Orcs were quite content to wait\nFrom Jugular well-watered\nAnd fed by fertile fungus fields\nIn Caves of Dark Abundance\nThe Men, they thought, would tire and leave\nTo go back to their families\nThey reckoned not the fire that burned\nIn Joile and Gaiden Shinji\nTen years their men sieged outer gate\nAnd finally Smelter faltered\nA decade more at second gate\nTill Hammer then was broken\nTen years again were spent in toil\nTill Temper fell asunder\nThen wrathful Men at last went in\nOrsinium to plunder\nGolkarr prayed in Grudgement Hall\nFor Mauloch to defend him\nBut King Joile took him by the hair\nAnd Gaiden Shinji slew him"
