        "(A Sea Chanty of the Long Coast)\nThe sea it rises with a mighty roar\nThe wind it blows from a distant shore\nThe waves they speed us on our way\nThe ship she dances in the spray!\nAll hands to halyards, hoist away!\nSet sails to full and no delay!\nThe course we set we must sail true\nOr sink ourselves in the briny blue!\nLook to the port above the beach\nOur destination we will reach\nFor our captain's is a will of steel\nBreak his trust and you'll kiss the keel!\nThe sea it settles on the shore\nThe wind will blow us nevermore\nThe waves are calm, there is no spray\nOur ship sets sail some other day."
