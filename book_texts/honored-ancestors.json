        "Ondre Veloth",
        "The Master Archer of Molag Amur\nWith honor and strength and a bow bestowed by Almalexia\nHe held the pass near Lake Nabia for 9 days\nCursed be the Sload who brought him to his end",
        "Valyne Veloth",
        "Weep not for Valyne Veloth\nShe toasted her enemies after battles waged\nHer hand promised to the man who killed her father\nShe stood as poison ran through her veins\nNo muscle or movement betrayed her\nWatching as they all toasted her in kind\nAnd fell poisoned to the last\nWith a smile she dropped her cup and\nAt last fell herself",
        "Elms Veloth",
        "Fed the family and retainers of the Veloth line\nThroughout the long Year of Great Hunger\nHe toiled to nourish the bodies of kith and kin\nNo meat or wheat passed his lips\nUntil everyone else ate their fill\nWhen the rains came he laid down\nHis sacrifice a nourishment and honor\nAs the crops blossomed and fed our people"
