        "When Demons came to Khenarthi's land\nShe knew that this was fate\nHer children made a final stand\nAnd opened the Crimson Gate",
        "First came Alkosh proud and strong\nGolden crowned his golden mane\nHe saw these things did not belong\nAnd that they must be slain",
        "Down came mighty Lorkhaj then\nHis blade burned shining blue\nHe fought the darkness back again\nand ran the Demons through",
        "Last came Hircine mourning Nirni\nWhose cairn he made of bone\nFrom wooded green to blackened sea\nHe watched over her alone"
