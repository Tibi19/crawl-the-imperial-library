        "While Hagravens have long been associated with certain Reachman tribes, the relationship between the Reachmen and these monsters is still unclear.",
        "With the face of an old crone and a misshapen body that combines human and raven, Hagravens are horrific sights. (Though they are far worse to smell.)",
        "It is the remnants of their meals that induce the greatest horror, however. For Hagravens consume people, preferably while still alive. They are said to be especially fond of eyeballs. A sated Hagraven will sometimes merely suck out a victim's eyes, then cast out the unfortunate to wander sightless through the wilds."
