        "Another month come and gone and no sign of Falinesti. I received letters from the Summer site with the same news. I fear we may never see the city in our lifetime. How does this happen? How does an entire city just vanish? Questions we've asked a hundred times and still no answer.",
        "Perhaps we should abandon our watch once and for all. We had lives, once, lives we could return to. Please write soon and let me know what you think. I miss you and the children. We could reunite in Elden Root and at least \u2026 for a time \u2026 be together.",
