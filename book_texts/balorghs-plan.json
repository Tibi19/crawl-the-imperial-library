        "I now know without a shadow of a doubt that Balorgh schemes to usurp you! He's entered us into a Great Hunt, and plans to win Hircine's boon in order to gain the power to overthrow you. Though he has not said this outright, instead making petty excuses as to how the boon will be used to benefit our pack, I know his words to be nothing but lies.",
        "I cannot stop him alone, and I dare not risk my position by outing myself as your spy. As such, I will keep Balorgh under observation and wait for a time to strike. I am unable to defeat him in combat, I know this, but I swear to you that I will do everything in my power to stop him.",
        "Yours faithfully,\nRonela"
