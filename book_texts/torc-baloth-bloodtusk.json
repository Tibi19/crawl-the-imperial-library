        "Known as the Wild Boar of Orsinium, Baloth Bloodtusk battled the enemies of Wrothgar, especially the invading hordes of the Bretons and Redguards.",
        "His legendary torc, a heavy chain bearing a hammer, saved him from a Redguard's attack when it deflected a blade thrust. The chain snapped, however, and the torc was lost to history near what is today called Honor's Rest."
