        "When you convinced me to buy this Moons-cursed kwama mine, Maelaya had no idea that it was overrun with the creatures! How are we to collect eggs when those horrible warriors patrol every hall? And this place is like a maze. So big! Why were we not even given a map?",
        "This one knew we should have never trusted your braggart of an uncle. He's played us both for fools, getting this mess of a mine off his paws and making a tidy profit as well!",
        "Maelaya wants you to find another buyer quickly, before the workers start spreading rumors. Try to find someone foolish enough to take this cursed kwama mine off our hands. Until then, we must abandon this foul place and hope the creatures can fend for themselves.",
