        "Lady Murcien was unsound\nShe thought she was a Dwarf\nScattered Dwarven ore around\nFrom north ridge to the wharf\nPut a hissing teapot on\nAn axle with a wheel\nSaid it was a construct come\nFrom Klathzgar, true for real\nMade some tools from brass and tin\nFor a \"Tonal Architect\"\nFired the forge and thrust them in\nHer house exploded, wrecked\nDonned a suit of brazen plate\nWith spiral blade on top\nStuck a soul gem in the grate\nAnd vanished with a pop!"
