        "I'm sorry. I know you wished these voices I heard were only in my mind. That the images I perceived were my imagination. They are not, though. These visions\u2014these voices that speak to me\u2014they are something more.",
        "A divine presence speaks to me through this stone. I do not understand why these words seek me out, but the voice\u2014it only grows stronger. With it comes the blinding lights. The strange visions. She's trying to find another knight to carry her light, she says. One who will not betray her. One who must correct a previous mistake.",
