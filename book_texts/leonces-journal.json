        "I can't believe how much gold Northpoint is willing to pay for a few dirty Orcs. Just a few more days, and I can go far away and spend my earnings in peace.",
        "In the meantime, I convinced our coward of a mayor to mobilize the Fell's Brigade, giving me all the power I need to manipulate opinions here in Fell's Run and acquire the captives my benefactor to the north is willing to pay so handsomely to receive.",
        "We continue to abduct Orcs, and I've even allowed the troops to steal whatever they want from the town. Then we blame the Orcs! It's a perfect scheme, if I do say so myself. I've promised the troops that they can divide up the stolen goods when we're finished inciting trouble. Maybe I'll even keep my promise, when all is said and done. I will take my own cut of the profits, of course.",
        "Until then, however, we'll use the basement of this lovely inn to store the stolen goods.",
        "The Wood Elf actually looked mad enough to attack me when I commandeered the premises. How amusing she was, screaming and waving her tiny fists in the air! Displaying her deed of ownership as though a piece of fancy parchment was going to keep me from taking over the Run Inn. Perhaps I won't burn the place to the ground when we're finished here. Or perhaps I shall. It will depend upon my mood at the time, I suppose."
