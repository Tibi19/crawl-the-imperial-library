        "We have no record of a \"cloud emulsifier\" device or anything involving the magical manipulation of the clouds. Second, we can't send you a sample of the Heart of Lorkhan for experimentation, as no such sample exists. And finally, in the fourteenth paragraph of your letter, you mention a substance called \"greenmote.\" We're assuming this was a simple mistake and you meant to write \"greenspore.\" If that's the case, we have contaminated skeever carcasses with the disease available if needed.",
        "We'd also like to thank you for sending us your notes regarding your experiments, we've all had quite a grand time reading them.",
