        "Dear person who happened upon this letter, it is your lucky day! Nearby you will find the Fork of Horripilation. Oh, how I do love cutlery! \"But what is it?\" you must be asking. Well, horripilation is the standing of hairs on end due to cold, fear, or excitement -- and excitement is indeed upon us, my friend!",
        "Take this fork, and use it to kill two special Bull Netches in single combat. Each will yield an artifact: The Eye of Ciirta, and the Branch of the Tree of Shades. Warriors of another age might find these familiar. Combine these together with some Heart Stones at a Staff Enchanter for a special surprise!",
        "If you're successful, you'll be rewarded quite handsomely, with the Staff of Sheogorath (handsome, indeed!) If not, well... I do love to watch a good fight!",
        "Yours Truly,\nLord Sheogorath"
