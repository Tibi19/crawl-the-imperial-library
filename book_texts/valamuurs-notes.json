        "Manipulating the stone is a matter of casting an appropriate Conjuration spell. Construction of the city can begin in earnest.",
        "8th Sun's Dawn",
        "The wildlife in the jungle has grown nettled\u2014perhaps understandably so, due to the work. We'll need to move faster. The sooner we complete colonization of this region, the better.",

        "2nd First Seed 2E 292",
        "Arandore disappeared this morning. He's been prone to nocturnal tirades, lately\u2014too much wine, I think\u2014but I don't begrudge him the drink. The jungle wildlife has grown decidedly unpleasant over time, going so far as to attack our builders. I hope Arandore is safe.",
        "7th Rain's Hand",
        "Arandore is gone. More builders go missing with every passing week. Progress has slowed to a crawl. I'm the only conjurer left fit to work. Won't give up. For the sake of those vanished, I'll complete our work.",
        "8th Second Seed",
        "I'm all that's left of our venture, and I must be going mad. I could swear I saw Arandore this evening, standing amongst the vines. I called to him, if it was him, but he didn't seem to notice. I thought I saw him retreat to the lower chambers, among the first of Root Sunder that we built. There aren't any more attendants to send\u2014there isn't anyone left. I'll have to investigate on my own."
