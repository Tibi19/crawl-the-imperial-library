        "Things have gotten strange around the Wyrd Tree since you've been traveling. Remember those weird vines that began sprouting a few weeks ago? Well, they've grown huge and they seem \u2026 evil \u2026 somehow. I know it sounds crazy, but that's the only way I can describe it. Evil with a capital \"E.\"",
        "I noticed that the forest animals have become agitated and even aggressive when they get close to the strange vines. Moreover, as the vines grow stronger, the aggressive behavior lasts longer. I'm beginning to fear that the creatures will attack soon. That's how much the presence of the vines has changed them.",
        "And now it's worse than I feared. Some of the vines have mutated, and now they spawn lurchers from their corrupted thorns.",
        "I'm sorry, Wyress, but I can't stay here any longer. Bloodthorn cultists have attacked us and taken control of the portal stone caves beneath our huts. I can't prove it, but I'm certain these cultists are responsible for our recent troubles. I have failed you, but I hope you can forgive me. I know you won't listen, but I urge you to stay away from the Wyrd Tree until this all blows over.",
