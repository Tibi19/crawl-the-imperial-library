        "It seems I only just signed on with the Albatross, but it's been more than two years since I saw the great Elden Tree or walked along a forest path in Brackenleaf. To think I might return home with a share of treasure and a King's pardon\u2014my gran won't be able to swallow, her tongue'll swell so big!",
        "And da. He'll see all this \"seagoing nonsense\" wasn't a waste! I remember the first day he took me to Haven. I think he meant to scare me with the size of the ships and the crashing of the waves, but all I could hear were the calls of the gulls and the chatter of sailors. So much different than the crows and ravens of Valenwood! I took every chance to go to the beaches after that.",
        "But mam always believed in me. Even when I told them I was leaving Southpoint. She cried, of course, because that's what mams do when their sons leave. But she had no harsh words for me.",
        "I hope my share of the treasure has a few gemstones or pearls I can bring back to her. I don't think she's ever seen a pearl."
