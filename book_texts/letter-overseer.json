        "More and more vampires arrive in Blackreach every day. Their attacks grow more frequent. I can only fight off so many before your miners realize the danger and abandon the town. I believe Captain Ageran already suspects something. You must speak with him soon to quell his concerns.",
        "As promised, I am doing all that I can to protect your venture. But with the rise in attacks, the situation is more arduous than I anticipated. Due to the increased risk, I require additional blood donors. Preferably weaker targets whose disappearance will likely go unnoticed.",
        "If you have reservations about this, remember that I have proof of our arrangement. If you want this to remain between us, do as I ask.",
