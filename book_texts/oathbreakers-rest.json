        "Being divided into two parts, the Bosmer who accepted the Green Pact were blessed by Y'frre and dwelt in the forests\u2014but those who rejected the Pact were cursed. Their ever-changing forms were stripped of life and tossed into the great tar-pits of Ouze, where they sank into eternal slumber.",
        "The spirits of Ouze are restless, however, and the Oathbreakers may return one day. They may return to seek vengeance on their brethren, but our eternal hope is that they will eventually accept the Green Pact, returning to Y'frre's favor and the arms of their people."
