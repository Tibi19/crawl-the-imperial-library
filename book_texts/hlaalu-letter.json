        "My dearest Dolvara,",
        "Your efforts on behalf of House Hlaalu in regards to our interests in Balmora excite me to no end. Best to keep the houses on equal footing, and what better way to accomplish that than by mutual trust and cooperation between two influential insiders? The information you passed along was exceedingly helpful. Take this beautiful collection of jewels as a thank you. Hopefully they'll keep you enthralled until my next visit.",
        "Speaking of visits, our mutual associates in House Dres have agreed to finally meet with you face to face. I'm sure the same charms you used to captivate me will have a similar effect on the Dres agent. Once you get to know each other a little better, I have no doubt that you'll be able to improve the slave trade a hundredfold. Why let the Tribunal and a few Pact rules get in the way of profit and our cherished way of life?",
