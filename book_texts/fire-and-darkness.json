        "\"Brother, I still call you brother for we share our bonds of blood, tested but unbroken by hatred.\u00a0 Even if I am murdered, which seems inevitable now, know that, brother.\u00a0 You and I are not innocents, so our benedictions of mutual enmity is not tragedy, but horror.\u00a0 This state of silent, shadowed war, of secret poisons and sleeping men strangled in their beds, of the sudden arrow and the artful dagger, has no end that I can see.\u00a0 No possibility for peace.\u00a0 I see the shadows in the room move though the flame of my candle is steady.\u00a0 I know the signs that I... \"",
        "This note was found where it had fallen beneath the floorboards of an abandoned house in the Nordic village of Jallenheim in the 358th year of the second era.\u00a0 It was said that a quiet cobbler lived in the house, whispered by some to be a member of the dread Morag Tong, the assassin's guild outlawed throughout Tamriel thirty-four years previously.\u00a0 The house itself was perfectly in order, as if the cobbler had simply vanished.\u00a0 There was a single drop of blood on the note.",
        "The Dark Brotherhood had paid a call.",
        "This note and others like it are rare.\u00a0 Both the Morag Tong and its hated child, the Dark Brotherhood, are scrupulous about leaving no evidence behind - their members know that to divulge secrets of their orders is a lethal infraction.\u00a0 This obviously makes the job of the historian seeking to trace their histories very difficult.",
        "The Morag Tong, according to most scholars, had been a facet of the culture of Morrowind almost since its beginning.\u00a0 After all, the history of Resdayn, the ancient name of Morrowind, is rife with assassination, blood sacrifice, and religious zealotry, hallmarks of the order.\u00a0 It is commonly said that the Morag Tong then as now murdered for the glory of the Daedra Prince Mephala, but common assumptions are rarely completely accurate.\u00a0 It is my contention that the earliest form of the Tong additionally worshipped an even older and more malevolent deity than Mephala.\u00a0 As terrifying as that Prince of Oblivion is, they had and have reverence for a far greater evil.",
        "Writs of assassination from the first era offer rare glimpses into the Morag Tong's earliest philosophy.\u00a0 They are as matter of fact as current day writs, but many contain snatches of poetry which have perplexed our scholars for hundreds of years.\u00a0 \"Lisping sibilant hisses,' 'Ether's sweet sway,' 'Rancid kiss of passing sin,' and other strange, almost insane insertions into the writs were codes for the name of the person to be assassinated, his or her location, and the time at which death was to come.\u00a0 They were also direct references to the divine spirit called Sithis.",
        "Evidence of the Morag Tong's expertise in assassination seems scarcely necessary.\u00a0 The few instances of someone escaping a murder attempt by them are always remarkable and rare, proving that they were and are patient, capable murderers who use their tools well.\u00a0 A fragment of a letter found among the effects of a well-known armorer has been sealed in our vaults for some time.\u00a0 It was likely penned by an unknown Tong assassin ordering weapons for his order, and offers some illumination into what they looked for in their blades, as well the mention of Vounoura, the island where the Tong sent its agents in retirement --",
        "'I congratulate you on your artistry, and the balance and heft of your daggers.\u00a0 The knife blade is whisper thin, elegantly wrought, but inpractical.\u00a0 It must have a bolder edge, for arteries, when cut, have a tendencies to self seal, preventing adequate blood loss.\u00a0 I will be leaving Vounoura in two weeks time to inspect your new tools, hoping they will be more satisfactory.'",
        "The Morag Tong spread quietly throughout Tamriel in the early years of the second era, worshipping Mephala and Sithis with blood, as they had always done.",
        "When the Morag Tong assassinated the Emperor Reman in the year 2920 of the first era, and his successor, Potentate Versidae-Shae in the 324th year of the second era, the assassins so long in the shadows were suddenly thrust into the light.\u00a0 They had become brazen, drunk with murder, literally painting the words 'MORAG TONG' on the wall in the Potentate's blood.",
        "The Morag Tong was instantly and unanimously outlawed in all corners of Tamriel, with the exception of its home province of Morrowind.\u00a0 There they continued to operate with the blessings of the Houses, apparently cutting off all contact with their satellite brothers to the west.\u00a0 There they continue their quasi-legal existence, accepting black writs and murdering with impunity.",
        "Most scholars believe that the birth of the Dark Brotherhood, the secular, murder-for- profit order of assassins, was as a result of a religious schism in the Morag Tong.\u00a0 Given the secrecy of both cults, it is difficult to divine the exact nature of it, but certain logical assumptions can be made.",
        "In order to exist, the Morag Tong must have appealed to the highest power in Morrowind, which at that time, the Second Era, could only have been the Tribunal of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec.\u00a0 Mephala, whom the Tong worshipped with Sithis, was said to have been the Anticipation of Vivec.\u00a0 Is it not logical to assume that in exchange for toleration of their continued existence, the Tong would have ceased their worship of Mephala in exchange for the worship of Vivec?",
        "The Morag Tong continues, as we know, to worship Sithis.\u00a0 The Dark Brotherhood is not considered a religious order by most, merely a secular organization, offering murder for gold.\u00a0 I have seen, however, proof positive in the form of writs to the Brotherhood that Sithis is still revered above all.",
        "So where, the reader, asks, is the cause for the schism?\u00a0 How could a silent war have begun, when both groups are so close?\u00a0 Both assassin's guilds, after all, worship Sithis.\u00a0 And yet, a figure emerges from history who should give those with this assumption pause.",
        "The Night Mother.",
        "Who the Night Mother is, where she came from, what her functions are, no one knows.\u00a0 Carlovac Townway in his generally well-researched historical fiction 2920: The Last Year of the First Era tries to make her the leader of the Morag Tong.\u00a0 But she is never historically associated with the Tong, only the Dark Brotherhood.",
        "The Night Mother, my dear friend, is Mephala.\u00a0 The Dark Brotherhood of the west, unfettered by the orders of the Tribunal, continue to worship Mephala.\u00a0 They may not call her by her name, but the daedra of murder, sex, and secrets is their leader still.\u00a0 And they did not, and still do not, to this day, forgive their brethren for casting her aside.",
        "The cobbler who met his end in the second era, who saw no end in the war between the Brotherhood and the Tong, was correct.\u00a0 In the shadows of the Empire, the Brothers of Death remain locked in combat, and they will likely remain that way forever."
