        "One must be wary of the desert lizards. Two are poisonous, one eats only live flesh, but the rest are safe.",
        "This one has found it nearly impossible to tell one from the other by their looks. Only by learning their individual attributes can one be sure of the lizard one has in hand.",
        "They can be tamed with patience. Approach carefully, and offer small bugs (watch for the flesh-eater). As they become used to your scent, they will learn to obey."
