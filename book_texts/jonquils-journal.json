        "Urval wanted so badly to make a go at being farmers, so here we are now with our own rocky plot of land and a ruined old farmhouse with a leaky roof. It's not what I dreamed of, but we'll make the best of it.",
        "",
        "At least the soil's good, even if it's full of boulders. I'll be able to get a nice garden going, with all the ingredients I need for my potions. The income from that should get us through the first winter, if nothing else.",

        "I found a secret room walled off in the basement. It will do nicely for my alchemy lab; I love my husband dearly, but he can be a pig-headed dolt when it comes to the gentle magics of the earth. If it weren't for my potions, little Rin would have perished last winter from a fever.",

        "It's been three days now. My little boy is still gone. I don't like how <Alias=Husband> is looking at me - his eyes are too dark, too still, like a frozen lake. I think I even heard him mutter something about \"getting what I deserve.\"",
