        "Thank you, my son, for humoring your father one last time.",
        "I know you have always preferred swords to books, and though you may think that's been a disappointment to me, the opposite is true. I've been impressed with your independence, and I'm proud of the man you've grown to be.",
        "My father was a soldier. He often complained that I was too \"bookish.\" When you were born, I vowed not to treat you that way.",
        "Though I could not bear to watch you march off to war while I was living, you now have my blessing. I sold my books, and I've left you what I hope will be a generous inheritance. Take it and buy yourself a strong sword and a sturdy suit of armor.",
        "Follow your heart, my son, and find your happy destiny.",
        "With love,\nYour father, Frodibert Fontbonne"
