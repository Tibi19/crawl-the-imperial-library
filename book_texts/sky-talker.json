        "This drum was used by an unknown Argonian slave during one of the many slave rebellions in Shadowfen. Although the owner's name is lost to history, oral tradition says the drum, named Sky-Talker, was used to send messages to different slave gangs during the revolt. \"Drum voices\" are often described as inspiring the rebels to great deeds.",
        "This drum is a reminder to all bards that even in the worst of times, music can raise the spirit and inspire the soul."
