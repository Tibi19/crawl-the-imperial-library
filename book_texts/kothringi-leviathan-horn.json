        "The extinct Kothringi people of Black Marsh have left very few relics behind, but the Bards College cherishes this mournful instrument as a reminder of their culture and the ravages of the Knahaten Flu.",
        "This cheerful bugle was fashioned from the horn of a leviathan, a creature of terrible power that roams Black Marsh, and dyed with silver-blue pigments to match the skin color of the lost Kothringi people.",
        "The loud, ringing tones are as joyful and uplifting as the Kothringi people in their prime."
