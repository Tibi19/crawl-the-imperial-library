        "By Maelmoth, Master of Mysterious Illusions!",
        "I gathered them all. My beauties! My treasures! Such relics and oddities make antiquarians weep! The boots of a wastrel from Wayrest! A Hagraven's pot from the Reach! A little stone mammoth; one day I'll set him free. Marvelous! Mystical! The Mysterium's magnificence is beyond compare!",
        "But even these priceless prizes pale before the Bottle. Look at it! The crowning achievement of a lifetime's work. Illusion magic honed and perfected! Is the Bottle an illusion, or is it real? If you touch it, are you the illusion? Does it matter? Ho ho! One must touch it to find out!",
        "Behold! The Nested Illusion! With even the lightest touch, the illusion makes way, changes shape, and welcomes the curious into its embrace. An illusion that begets still more illusions!",
        "Consider the applications! Like those hateful bards, incessantly mocking my mastery of verse and wordplay! What if they picked up a lute and became the lute? Who would know? I would. I would! I, Maelmoth the Mysterious. The Master of Illusion! Ha!",
        "Ha! Ha-ha! HA HA HA HA HA HA!"
