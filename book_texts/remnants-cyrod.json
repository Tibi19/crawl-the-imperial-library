        "When Alessia's rebellion sent the Heartland lords fleeing from their manses, they took their knowledge with them.",
        "While some fled to the fens of Black Marsh and others to the northern reaches, most flew to Valenwood. After many years amongst the Bosmer, they amassed a storehouse of information.",
