        "At sixty winters she left Skyrim for good\nShe found this place and made it her home\nAt sixty-one summers she built this place\nShe took only from the ground to make it\nAs is the custom in Valenwood\nAt sixty-two summers she met the Silvenar\nShe offered to teach the ways of her people\nFor she knew much of making things\nAt sixty-two winters she taught his people\nShe learned as much as she taught\nAnd was loved by all her students",
        "At eighty winters she went to Sovngarde\nShe left this place to all who would teach\nAnd to all who would learn"
