        "\u2014 Two distinct species: land dreugh and water dreugh.\n\u2014 Both were once common throughout Vvardenfell, Ebonheart, and the surrounding waters. They've been driven out over the last few centuries and only exist now in isolated pockets.\n\u2014 Some accounts assert there are two varieties of land dreugh, while others maintain these are but the male and female versions of one kind of creature.\n\u2014 Legends tell of \"civilized\" land dreugh colonies which supposedly raised herds of mudcrabs as food stock.\n\u2014 These colonies were also purported to have built stone cairn houses and structures.\n\u2014 No evidence of such advanced dreugh behavior exists today.\n\u2014 Dreugh are omnivores and have been witnessed consuming mer flesh.\n\u2014 Dreugh are capable of channeling some form of shock energy through their bodies. Most scholars agree this is a natural adaptation and not magical in nature.\n\u2014 The land dreugh carapace is naturally sturdy and can deflect most attacks from common weapons.\n\u2014 No known language or communication abilities.\n\u2014 Nesting habits are not well-documented, but we do know the land dreugh encase their egg broods in mud. Nothing is known about water dreugh nesting or egg-laying behavior.\n\u2014 Some fisherfolk are known to gather land dreugh eggs from the creatures' mud-nests, though it is obviously a rather dangerous occupation.",
