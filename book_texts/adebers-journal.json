        "16, Sun's Dusk",
        "Given my lack of success scrying with the Ebony sphere, I've moved on to augury. I started with starlings, but they never stayed for long. Too unpredictable - too dependent on the shared movement of the flock. I had some measured success with vultures, but the repetition gives me vertigo. Round and round and round they go. Telling the same story again and again.",
        "I was surprised to find that I've had the most success with crows. They're perceptive, adaptable, and seem just as interested in the process as I am. I released a few yesterday, and breathed deep from my Nirn-powder box. Before long, the birds started weaving patterns - some Daedric letters I think. Soon afterward, most of the birds gathered into a hoop of sorts, while the largest soared through it - spinning like a half-fletched arrow. A corkscrew? Or perhaps a key? I counted sixteen passes before they finally settled back into their coops.",
        "I can't help but think it relates to a door. Or perhaps a portal? Doors, always doors! And sixteen passes? Sixteen Princes. It can't be a coincidence. But where is this door? Do they speak of the artifact's position or the artifact itself? More questions. Always more questions. I should confer with Neelo. I think he's done something similar with fish. If we don't make more progress soon, I think we'll have to inform the Arch-Mage. We've spent too much time already. Mara knows what terrors this Daedric artifact could unleash."
