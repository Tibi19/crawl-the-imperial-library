        "But since I'm not good enough to be Her Hand, just for fun I started calling myself Almalexia's Toe. Dirty little toe at that, with a lot of ash under the nail.",
        "",
        "Anyways, I tossed the idea to Indobar, and knocked back another pint as the veins on his forehead started popping. I also offered to anoint Sindras as Almalexia's navel, because why not? There's enough body parts on her ladyship for all of us.",
        "",
        "Indobar didn't think it was very funny. Must be in the blood. Same goes for me, after all. My ancestors were Armigers. Loyal to Vivec, and more importantly, knew how to take a joke.",
