        "Eydis stayed back on the gears to hold off those metal monsters, but she hasn't shown up so I'm going to press on and hope for the best. Unfortunately, my progress has been blocked by a gate that I can't pry open. Following the pipes, it appears that the gate is controlled by the large boiler in the center of the room. I'm going to try shooting the resonators with an arrow to see if that opens the gate.",

        "My first attempt didn't work very well. Each of the resonators appeared to route steam when I shot them and things on the boiler started to glow blue, which seemed like a good sign. Unfortunately, once I shot a few of the resonators, the lights started turning orange, all the steam vented from the boiler, and several dwarven constructs came out and attacked me. Still, the Visage of Mzund must be here so I'm going to try again.",
        "I'm sure there has to be a trick to it. Perhaps if I can fill the central boiler with just the right amount of pressure. I seem to recall",

        "that three parts lit up when I hit the resonator on the left. I'm going to try from the right this time and keep track as I go.\n",
