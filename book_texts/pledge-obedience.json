        "Be ever obedient to king and clergy. Duty does not heed bright disposition and defy a dark one. A good king has no more right to obedience than a poor one. Both priest and king serve as the voice of the Stars' will. Though they may be sour as unripened figs or hard as uncut stone, they must be obeyed. For obedience is the warrior's armor, and the armor is strong.",
