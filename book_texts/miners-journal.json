        "<bold>3rd of Hearthfire, 4E 200\nYou know, just when you think you've hit bottom, sometimes the Aedra throw you a rope. Since the rebels took over the mines in these parts, I haven't been able to find work anywhere. And along comes Bern, my old partner, with an deed to some old gold mine out in the hills.</bold>",
        "It's been too long since we did a job together- what, four years now? Nice to finally work with someone who knows the business. Sounds like the place was a steal, too.\n",
        "<bold>22nd of Hearthfire, 4E 200\nNo one sells a mine for a song. I figured the place would be in bad shape, but not this bad- barely a glorified cave. There may have been gold here once, but we don't even have a vein to start with.</bold>",
        "We struck out at random. Three weeks digging the lower tunnel, but nothing to show for it yet.\n",
        "<bold>15th of First Seed, 4E 201\nNothing. No gold, no gems, no ore, not even any useful stone- the rocks around here crumble the moment you stack one on another. I'm ready to toss it in, but Bern wants to keep on going. \"Just a little farther, Hadrir.\" \"We're so close, Hadrir.\" Bah.</bold>",
        "Bern wants me to head back to Riften for supplies next week. Might give me a chance to cool down.\n",
        "<bold>29th of First Seed, 4E 201\nSo I come back, and- nothing. No sign of Bern. It's like he just up and left. No blood, no struggle, he just ran out on me, I suppose.</bold>",
        "I've waited three days, and he's not coming back. I'm going to head back to Riften and see if I can find him, or find some other work there. No sense wasting any more time here.",
        "Bern, if you find this- I expected better from you.",
