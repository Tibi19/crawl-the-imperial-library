        "These old burial mounds should provide some inspiration for my writing. Ancient heroes of Glenumbra are entombed here. I'm sure they have some interesting exploits I can expand upon. Something that will get me the recognition I deserve. And finally get me a cushy position with a noble family.",
        "A duke or duchess as a sponsor would be just the thing I need to advance my writing career. Regular meals, a nice roof over my head, conversation with people who know how to read.",
        "* * *",
        "There's so little information on the people buried here. Donel Deleyn? A King of Glenumbra? Never heard of the fellow. But I can make him interesting. Heroic. Maybe give him a band of loyal warriors, fending off whoever would be attacking them. (Note to Self: Look up significant battles of the First Era that took place in Glenumbra for reference.)",
        "* * *",
        "I think I can spin an entire series around this! Each hero gets their own tale. I haven't seen anything in old history texts about this Deleyn fellow. Or someone called the \"Golden Prince\" or the \"Ivory Lord,\" for that matter. Their stories are lost to time.",
        "* * *",
        "Lots of heroic battles, maybe a little romance. I did spot a tomb for \"The Emerald Princess.\" Of course, she must be beautiful, with eyes the color of purest emeralds. And a brave warrior. She and the King can be star-crossed lovers. I just need to flesh this out a bit. I don't want to write some sort of silly romance, after all. This has to be real history. Just enhanced a little. This is bound to get me published!",
        "Best of all, it will put that hack Felari-ko off his drink. \"Scholar of Intriguing Mysteries.\" Bah. Pretentious cat scribbles, I say. All he does is make up nonsense about his adventures and shill for his next so-called mystery. I can do so much better than that!",
