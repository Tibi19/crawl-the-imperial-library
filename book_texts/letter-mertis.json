        "It brought me great joy to hear you accepted my contract. You come highly recommended, despite your arcane handicaps. This task requires discretion and, I fear, some measure of martial prowess. If the stories are true, you possess both in ample measure.",
        "The recently elevated Argonian, Sun-in-Shadow, shows ambition well beyond her station. My contacts tell me she plans to purchase land outside Vos for Master Firuth\u2014one of my witless rivals.",
        "The task is simple: travel to Vos and keep watch for Sun-in-Shadow's associate. Once this henchman chooses a plot, swoop in, secure the deed, and make haste to a secluded spot. Use the enclosed calling-crystal to signal me. I will travel to your location and exchange the second half of your fee for the deed. While I'd prefer a clean and bloodless acquisition, do not hesitate to use lethal force if necessary.",
        "I hope my faith in you is not misplaced. Remember, you serve the Great House Telvanni. Bring honor to yourself and your House.",
        "J"
