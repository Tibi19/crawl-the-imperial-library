        "Entry 2\nClear weather. By some ill-conceived joke we are to be joined by a squadron of Khajiit-led privateers. Something about \"appealing to the natives through diplomatic overture.\" Surely they have a better use for us than playing nursemaid to ruffians.",
        "Entry 3\nChoppy seas. If we're the pride of the Dominion, the privateers are its disgrace. A more ragtag assembly of barnacle-crusted vessels I've never set eyes upon! We would make better time if we scuttled the lot of them.",
        "Entry 4\nClear weather. Strange sails on the horizon. We've all heard the reports\u2014a Sea Viper fleet reaving along the coasts of Auridon\u2014though nothing to speak of a presence here. More Khajiit barnacles latching onto our hull? I would not be surprised. The Peregrine dispatched to investigate.",
        "Entry 5\nRough seas. The Peregrine was unable to locate its quarry and heavy winds will prevent us from pursuing further. Strange, our Sighter indicated clear weather for at least three days.",
