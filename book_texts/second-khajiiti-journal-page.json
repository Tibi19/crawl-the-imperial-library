        "Reached the Temple of Jode's Light, after much travel. Thunderbugs and bats fill the remains of the temple, but largely pose little threat to this one. They will be cleared out eventually, but the haunting is of greater concern. A dark presence permeates these walls.",
        "7 Mid Year",
        "It has been nearly a week. This one believes the dark presence is none other than an accursed dro-m'Athra. If the suspicion is correct, this temple is a very dangerous place. This one has left the bats and thunderbugs to dissuade errant travelers\u2014a danger, to be sure, but a lesser one compared to the dark spirit infesting this place."
