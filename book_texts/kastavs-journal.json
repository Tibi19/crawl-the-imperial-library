        "My memory of how I arrived here is scattered. Faint. That's what it does to you. Each drop of blood removes another detail. I can't see my son's face, although I know he had one.",

        "Others are here with me, chained in dirt. They call it Dremnaken. I can't remember if that's its name or kind. Its voice burrows into my mind. A thundering echo behind the eyes. Roars of constant hunger and cruelty.",

        "Only a few of us left in the holding pen. The Dremnaken cannot complete its hunt. It appears paler. Slower. It takes more and more of us for the scrying. I have gone two, no, maybe three times now. Each time it takes more of my life. I only know I had a son because I wrote it down before. But I still recall my name. Kastav.",

        "Before the Elf women disappeared, she told me a secret. There is a way out. A prisoner from before, someone I cannot remember, found a hole. A small portion of wall broken away. If a person could get free, perhaps they could crawl through it. How she learned of this, she couldn't recall. But she held fast to the story.",
