        "Skyrim Expedition - Day 1",
        "I have arrived in Skyrim to solve a single mystery, to find the lost sanctuary of Nchuanthumz. According to legend, it was built by the famed Dwemer architects, Klorgic and Duramac, the latter of whom is said to be a distant relative of the great Dumac Dwarfking.",
        "",
        "While the two began as rivals, through mutual respect and admiration they eventually became friends, and over time, much more.",
        "",
        "Whereas Klorgic was an architect of great renown, his palatial estates suffered from\u00a0 their excess - the size of his rooms matched only by their emptinesss. Duramac, on the other hand, was a genius engineer, but lacked the artistic vision to allow his inventions to reach their full potential.",
        "",
        "It's only when they joined forces to create Nchuanthumz that they built something truly profound. If I am to find their creation, I must grasp history itself by the tail.",
        "",
        "Skyrim Expedition - Day 17",
        "Our travels have brought us to this bleak, underground tunnel, which the natives call Frostroot Cave. Its winding cords of ice and rock make it truly a miserable place. My scales feel chilly, but more so my nerves.",
        "",
        "Luckily we've hired a few soldiers of fortune into our employ. Some would call them bandits, but I like to refer to them as mercenaries at a discount! Hopefully I can convince them not to touch the artifacts and keep the scrap instead."
