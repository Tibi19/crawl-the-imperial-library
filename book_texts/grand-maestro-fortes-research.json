        "An unknown language covers the massive stone discovered in the heart of Ebon Stadmont. I have been able to make some progress in formulating a key to translate the ancient language, but I have so little to work with save the writing on the stone.",
        "* * *",
        "The language is definitely older than anything I've studied in Tamriel or even in the whole of Nirn. I suspect it has some connection to Daedric, but as impossible as it sounds, I think this writing may even predate the language of Oblivion.",
        "* * *",
        "I was able to translate one of the stanzas on the stone, but I have no idea what it signifies.",
        "\"The crows lead the way,\nWhen our paths go astray,\nAnd the towering trees block the way.\"",
        "* * *",
        "My efforts continue to yield results. I found this stanza to be particularly mystifying.",
        "\"A pair of crows to begin your search,\nThen a lone crow upon a perch,\nBut it's not one or two that open the way,\nThe crows will have their say.\"",
        "* * *",
        "The more I study this mysterious language, the more anxious and concerned I become. It sometimes seems that just trying to unravel its meaning is garnering the attention of forces I can barely begin to understand. I think I'll put this research away for a while and turn my efforts to other projects.",
        "Perhaps I'll finish writing that comedy about the three Khajiit who lost their silken gloves."
