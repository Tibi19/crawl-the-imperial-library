        "Our experiments to enhance the abilities of imps have, universally, resulted in disastrous side effects, though this latest round of testing is perhaps the most spectacular example. When applying a serum concocted from the essence of an imp with affinity to frost to an imp with an affinity for fire the end result is not a creature with mastery over both, but a puddle. The unfortunate thing melted before our eyes, shrieking at ear splitting volumes until its throat collapsed. Or perhaps its lungs. Either way we wont be repeating that particular experiment again."
