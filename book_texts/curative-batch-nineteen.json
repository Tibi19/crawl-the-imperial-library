        "Ah, finally. Perfection! The latest batch of curative starts the affliction, progresses the plague at a reasonable rate of speed, and then turns the afflicted into plague husks seventy percent of the time. Now we have a superior version of the plague and an effective way to dispense it.",
        "Of course, handing out curatives can be a slow process, especially in the larger towns and cities. Before we begin operations in Mournhold, we'll need a faster way to disperse the plague. But that's not my task at this moment. Besides, I'm sure that Alchemist Merdyndril is tackling this problem even as I write these notes.\nI should also record that I've perfected the husk scent. We can once again walk among the husks without fear of being attacked. I might even have an idea about a soap to remove the scent after we're finished.",
        "We'll begin making larger batches of the curative immediately. In no time at all, we should be able to give everyone at the Serk and in the immediate vicinity a dosage of the curative. Don't worry, my mistress.",
        "Everything will happen, just as you have foreseen.",
