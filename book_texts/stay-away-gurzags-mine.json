        "No Orc is to go near Gurzag's mine. These orders are from your war chief.",
        "I hear you asking each other, when will we smash the undead in the mine and free our brothers?",
        "I am tired of hearing my orders questioned. The Orcs in the mine toyed with foul magic and Wood Elf trickery. That is why they suffer their fate.",
        "If you want to avenge them, look to the Wood Elves and their High Elf allies, with their dark magics and wicked schemes. Bloody their doorsteps and fill their ears with the cries of their children."
