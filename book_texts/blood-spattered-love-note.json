        "Tomorrow, I am going to the Underroot. The lamias there are friendly and they won't begrudge two lovers their secret spot by the moonlight.",
        "Come quietly, though, and wait until nightfall. I think J might suspect us. Oh, I don't feel any guilt about it. The way he carries on about those cats of his, he doesn't need a wife. But be careful just in case. He may not understand love, but he certainly understands ownership.",
