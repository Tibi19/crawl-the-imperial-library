        "Be very careful when you handle the holy vessel. It is the most important relic in our temple and the reason why our temple exists at all. Saint Veloth is best known for wielding his hammer, Veloth's Judgment, but he also carried this vessel in his time. Like many objects the saint blessed, it has the power to heal. But it also possesses a variety of other interesting magical properties. Indestructibility is not, unfortunately, one of them.",
