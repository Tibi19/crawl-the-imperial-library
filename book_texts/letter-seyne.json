        "The Three find you well, I hope. I have much to tell you. We've undertaken a full-scale irrigation project on the south side of town. One of the Argonians has shown us how to improve the ditch water system in place.\nWe miss you here, Seyne. One person leaving a small town like ours leaves a big gap to fill!",
        "Seyne, know we think of you often. I'm so proud to be your brother. I know you're fighting for the safety of the Pact and that you're making Father proud at Vivec's side. Just remember, you always have a home here.",
        "If the campaign ends, rest easy knowing you still have a bunk.\nFaithfully,\nSamel"
