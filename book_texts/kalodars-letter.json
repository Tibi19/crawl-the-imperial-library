        "But I loved you both dearly, and that is why I had to leave. You were no longer safe with me in the house, though you never suspected it. You knew of my debt, but not the dire threats my creditors had made. When I knew they were coming for me, I led them as far from you as I could. My prayers are only that my ruse succeeded and you are safe.",
