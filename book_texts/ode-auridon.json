        "Of all the lands in the Summerset Isles,\nAuridon, she outshines them all.\nWith her marble halls and towering spires,\nHer beauty surpass'd them all.\nFrom Vulkhel Guard to the First among Holds,\nHer strength outstrips them all.\nIn shadowed glade and quiet ruin,\nHer calm surprises all.\nIn steel and ship and flopping fish,\nHer coin out-trades them all.\nWith beauty and wit and subtle grin,\nHer Queen is best of all."
