        "Three servants and no fewer than six family members have been murdered in a fashion suggesting the vilest witchcraft.",
        "Several months ago, one of our patrols captured and executed a coven of Ice Witches from the north. We now have evidence that one of their kind escaped. I fear that she entered the castle for the celebration, disguised as a commoner, to enact her vengeance. Have trusted guards and servants seal all entrances to the castle immediately. All guests from the surrounding villages should be immediately placed under guard and restrained if necessary.",
        "This Ice Witch, Drodda, is aligned with the darkest powers of Oblivion and should be considered extremely dangerous. Kill her on sight."
