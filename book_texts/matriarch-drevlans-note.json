        "",
        "The box was to be placed in the armory, but never opened. In fact, his voice stumbled at the mere mention of it, and his hands gripped the edges as if to drop it would shatter the world. As such, I heeded his warning when he begged me never to look inside. To this day, I do not know how to open the rear gate.",
