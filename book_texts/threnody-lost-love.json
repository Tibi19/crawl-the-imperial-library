        "Deep within my mind\nThe storms, they gather inside me\nDeep within my mind\nThe tides rise far too high\nHiding in my mind\nThe sorrow whispers freely\nFear is so unkind\nShouting through my tears",
        "Please don't find me\nI can't be free\nPlease come find me\nYour death haunts me\nYour death haunts me",
        "Deep within my soul\nThe fires burn inside of me\nDeep within my soul\nPain rips through all I am\nLurking in my soul\nLoneliness beseeches me\nI'm no longer whole\nScreaming through my tears",
        "Please don't find me\nI can't be free\\nPlease come find me\nYour death haunts me\nYour death haunts me\nYour death haunts me"
