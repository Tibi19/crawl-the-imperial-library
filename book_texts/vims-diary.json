        "It's been a while since the last time I wrote, but it's not like a lot happens around here. Sure, the villagers say that their friends and family members have gone missing, but my father says they probably just left to avoid the plague. Oh, right, and then there's the Llodos plague, but I'm not too worried about that, either. My father's the House Minister! He won't let anyone that's part of House Hlaalu get sick, especially not his darling daughter. (That's me!)",
        "I saw a recruiting pamphlet for the Maulborn today. They were distributing them outside the gates of town. They say they're here to help, but I think there's something creepy about them. And I certainly don't like the outfits they make all their members wear. It's like they're some kind of an army or something. Still, there were a couple of cute-looking members wandering around down by the lake. I wonder what they like to do for fun when they're not saving the world? Maybe I'll sneak down there one night and take a look.",
        "There's a stranger in town. Finally, someone interesting to talk to! I can't wait to talk to the stranger. Hear about news from distant lands, listen to stories of thrilling adventures and forbidden romance. Maybe my father will let me invite the stranger over for dinner. That would be exciting! But it would be more exciting if we could go somewhere quiet, just the two of us. I need to think about that. I'm sure I can work out a way to make that happen.",
