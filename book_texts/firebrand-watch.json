        "The Lion Guard's laziness astounds me. They abandon forts left and right through High Rock, without any regard for strategy or defense. The most-recent location the Lion Guards ran from is Firebrand Watch. Rumor has it the Red Rooks made a fortune when they plundered the abandoned fortifications there. Hurry to Firebrand Watch and gather whatever hasn't been carted off. The Lion Guard's loss must be our gain."
