        "My most estimable Lakvan, You must understand you risk my wrath by continued association with this Pergan Asuul. Your claim he is a Shadomage opposed to Skelos Undriel is irrelevant. Shadow magics by their nature will twist on their casters and so do the words of the magic's practitioners. My plan to have utterly destroy Undriel can tolerate no such risk this close to fruition. End your association with Pergan Asuul or I shall end mine with you. Ponder that choice as you will.",
