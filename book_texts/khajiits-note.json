        "They tell Khajiit the body is buried at the far end of the cemetery in Falkreath. Khajiit will take a shovel and dig him up.",

        "To that end, this one has heard rumors of a bandit wearing Daedric Plate, plying his blood trade at Knifepoint Ridge. Originally Khajiit did not think Edward the type to live in an abandoned mine. But now he is not so sure.",
