        "Sweet Frelytte the Fair\nHair the color of hay,\nLike spun gold and honey\nBright sun at midday.",
        "She loved a boy named Pular\nAnd he loved her, too.\nAs fiercely as ice entombs lakes,\nAs surely as spring melts through.",
        "Her mouth as red as snowberries,\nHis hands calloused and true.\nHe left to hunt an ice wraith, saying\n\"I'll become worthy of you.\"",
        "After four nights of waiting,\nFrelytte rode into the snow.\nThe mountains howled with darkness,\nThe moon sank ever so low.",
        "But soon her horse grew tired,\nThe cold did lull her to sleep.\nShe curled up beneath a tree,\nUntil the storm buried her deep.",
        "Pular returned triumphantly,\nHe'd killed the wraith as he foretold.\nHe stopped at the base of a tree,\nWhere he saw a tuft of gold.",
        "He brushed away the snow, found her\nPale as cream and cold as death.\nBut Divines smiled on their love,\nAnd when he kissed her she drew breath.",
        "\"I've slayed the beast,\"\" Pular proudly cried,\nAnd Frelytte wept tears of joy.\nHand in hand, they ran home to marry,\nTheirs was a love that winter could not destroy."
