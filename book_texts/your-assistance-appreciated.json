        "My sincerest thanks for eliminating those who wished to harm my precious. With those vile hunters eliminated, I now have a chance track down my precious and rescue her. However, I found something in the wilderness that is quite disturbing. It appears my precious has become overly frightened. In her attempts to escape the things she fears, she ended up traversing what I can only describe as a portal to Oblivion.",

If you encounter this note instead of me, then it means I have not found a way back from wherever those portals lead.",
