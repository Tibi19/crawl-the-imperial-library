        "The information you have provided so far hints at a terrible threat not only to Skyrim, but potentially to all of Tamriel. My liege, Jorunn the Skald-King, wants to stop this threat before it grows in scope and power, but I need more details. I need proof to convince the authorities in Solitude that the threat is real and they need to accept the Skald-King's help. I'm counting on you.",
