        "[Player Name], Accept this invitation, carried by one of my most-trusted messengers, in friendship and respect. In the name of the mighty King Kurog, I bid you welcome and invite you to test your mettle in the wilds of majestic Wrothgar. The Orsimer care not where your loyalties lie. Come help us rebuild the city of Orsinium and squelch the Winterborn menace. Aid the king in his worthy endeavors and riches and honors will be bestowed upon you. I have sent Ambassador Lazgara to meet you and offer you transportation to Wrothgar. You can find her in one of the following cities: Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard. Look for her when you arrive. I look forward to meeting you in person, as I've heard such wonderful accounts of your adventures. Present yourself to me when you arrive in Orsinium. Forge-Mother Alga, Orsinium, Wrothgar"
