        "The Lava Queen is the greatest Champion the Blessed Crucible has ever known. Her prowess in the Arena is unmatched, and she has ruled the Crucible for nearly four centuries. All challengers who have dared to face her in the Arena have been overwhelmed by her fiery magic, their bodies burned and charred beyond recognition. It is said that she exists purely for the Blessed Crucible, and the Crucible for her. Her mastery of the arena is so complete that the very ground shapes and molds itself to her will. To face her is to do battle with a living volcano of power and destruction.",
