        "[This worn, faded note was written on a scrap of parchment and secured by a piece of rawhide to the vampire's neck.]",
        "My name is Ghola gro-Muzgol. My companion's names are Aranalda, Nille Elf-Daughter, Avita Cassiana, and Umar gra-Khar.",
        "The vampire Dratik died by our hands, but the price was dear. Those into whose hands we have fallen, we thank you, and pray your favor.",
        "We served Lady Azura. Bring these, our last words, to the Her Shrine. We praise Her with the full fountain of our devotion.",
        "Our destinies were written in the stars, that our souls and reason be slain, and our world lost forever.",
        "None can escape Her Fate. But let us be remembered at Her shrine, and in the hearts of Her servants.",
        "\"It is only by fate\nthat any life ends,\nand only by chance\nthat it is mine...\nnot yours.\""
