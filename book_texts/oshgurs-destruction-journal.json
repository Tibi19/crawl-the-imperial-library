        "All the other students are already casting fireballs, and I can't even manage a damn spark! Mother was right, Orcs aren't made for magic. If I wasn't so afraid of the shame, I'd pack up and go home right now. I deserve to work in the mines for the rest of my life. The other apprentices are constantly laughing at me. This was the worst idea I've ever had. Orcs just can't be sorcerers!",
        "8th Sun's Height",
        "Master Dantaine convinced me to stay. He recommended books for me to read, said that knowledge is inspiration or something like that. I don't see how reading is going to help, but he said to trust him. These books look really hard\u2014they're about things like \"theory of emotional-magicka response\" and \"volitional interference factors.\" One's a biography of \"Guzgikh.\" Never heard of him, but I guess he was some Orc sorcerer. How about \"How to Teach a Dumb Orc Magic\"? I'd read that.",
        "15th Last Seed",
        "Ha! I caught that snooty Breton girl's hair on fire today, and managed a little lightning bolt. Even hit the target! I can't believe it; those books were just what I needed. They seemed really hard, but it was all about clearing out my head and not letting nerves stop me. And Guzgikh? Turns out he started the same way\u2014he didn't cast a spell for years, but before long could destroy a whole village! This is great!"
