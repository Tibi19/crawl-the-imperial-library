        "Sundas",
        "Strange movements in the sky. I thought I saw the Guardians appear for a moment. The Warrior, the Mage, the Thief. And then they flickered and vanished. I have a sickening feeling deep in my stomach, as if this is an omen of things to come.",
        "Consulted the tomes of the Star-Scryer. Nothing but vague prophecies of the stars falling from the sky, portending doom. Nothing speaking to this specific sign.",
        "We are afloat on a foreign sea, without a chart or astrolabe to guide us to safer shores. Our own Guardians have disappeared, abandoned us.",
        "Woe to us, children of a bitter age.\nWhen our children fall, who will catch them?\nFor they are all orphans,\nTheir mothers died in childbirth,\nTheir fathers died in war.\nLike the beggar on the street,\nThey beg for food and receive scorpions.",
        "Tirdas",
        "We are truly damned. Armies of sand giants have appeared in the foothills, attacking the precious Mundus Stones.",
        "Persons calling themselves the Celestials have attacked in every place in Craglorn. It's a miracle Dragonstar still stands. We have not heard anything from the city of Elinhir in too long.",
        "Do not hope for a better future.\nTime is devouring itself.\nOh you women in labor,\nOh you who are about to give birth.\nDash your children on the rocks,\nand poison your young ones.\nWho will stand when the stars fall?"
