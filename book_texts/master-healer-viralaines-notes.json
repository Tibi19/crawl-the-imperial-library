        "An unfortunate development has occurred. Roslenn discovered the laboratory. I had no choice but to sedate her with a large dose of the subject's blood. I'm simply too close to success to suspend my experiments now.",
        "",
        "While the circumstances are regrettable, Roslenn's case may provide new insights. To date, I have administered diluted doses of the subject's blood to patients in their food and drink.

        "",
        "I must administer the antidote to Roslenn soon, but then what? If she reports this incident to Lord Bacaro, it can only end in panic and recrimination. Yet I can hardly allow foolish overreactions to impede my research. Not when I am so close."
