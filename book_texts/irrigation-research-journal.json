        "\nTRIAL 22:",
        "ADJUSTMENT: Water alternative\nRESULTS: Crops initially thrived, eventually died\nNOTES: Animal urine employed as water alternative. Animals seemed to resent being held in place until urination occurred. Cats were especially difficult. Badilia vocally resented having to restrain animals and being splashed with urine. Had to pay bonus.",
        "\nTRIAL 23:",
        "ADJUSTMENT: Add rocks\nRESULTS: Crops failed to grow at all\nNOTES: Badilia said that rocks around plants help hold in moisture. Planted seeds and placed rocks on top. No crop growth noted at all. Suspect Badilia of ill intent.",
        "\nTRIAL 24:",
        "ADJUSTMENT: Add rocks, Part II\nRESULTS: Crops thrived\nNOTES: Badilia explained that rocks are applied after crops have sprouted. Eye rolling and sighing was excessive. Waited until crops broke through the ground, then placed rocks around stems. Success was noted. Badilia called it \"keeping their feet wet\"; confusing, as plants do not have feet.",
        "\nTRIAL 25:",
        "ADJUSTMENT: Constant moisture\nRESULTS: Test not yet complete\nNOTES: If some moisture is good for plants, then more must be better. Have flooded fields and am keeping plants constantly wet. Eye rolling detected from Badilia, but trial continues."
