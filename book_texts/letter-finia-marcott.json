        "You've no idea how long I debated sending this letter, but in the end I fear I must do what is best for myself and my esteemed relations. You have been a valuable friend and ally at court for many years, which makes me all the more shocked by the word I've received\u2014from several reputable sources, I might add\u2014about your recent political \u2026 \"activities.\"",
        "It is with a heavy heart and great regret that I inform you that I no longer wish to be associated with you in any way. Advocating the ideals you apparently stand for during a time of war and consorting with the company you have been spotted with is nothing short of treason, and I will not be associated with any of it.",
        "It is my hope that you may yet see the folly of your ways before it ruins you. Do not write back.",
