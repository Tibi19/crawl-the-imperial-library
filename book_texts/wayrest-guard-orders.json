        "It has come to my attention that members of the Guard have failed to show proper respect for citizens of the Orcish persuasion such as are seen more and more often these days within our walls. There have been reports of sneering, of spitting, of improper amorous propositions, and of suggestions that places other than Wayrest might be more appropriate destinations, and that the sooner the Orcish citizen went there, the better.",
        "This will not be tolerated. These Orcish citizens are now our allies, and deserve the same protection under the law as normal people. I don't care about the tusks. Get over it. Any Guard found mistreating an Orc who didn't deserve it will be suspended without pay for a period appropriate to the gravity of the misconduct.",
