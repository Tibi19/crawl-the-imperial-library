        "Crow \u2014 Good crunch! Reminds me of fen hen. Season with bamphor.",
        "Dog \u2014 Do not eat in front of allies. Nords take offense, as it's one of their sacred animals. Pet instead.",
        "Cat \u2014 Delicious! Again, do not eat in front of allies. Another sacred animal. Take from the street, and make sure to hide the tails.",
        "Goat \u2014 Everything but the horns. The horns are too tough.",
        "Wharf Rat \u2014 Baste in Bile Beer. Delicious! You'll get thanks from sailors, too!",
        "Monkey \u2014 So cute, but gamey. Smear on dragon's-tongue sap and baste in Theilul rum."
