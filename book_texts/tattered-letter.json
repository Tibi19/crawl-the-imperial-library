        "I met a colorful character tonight who regaled me with tales of a nearby haunted ruin. He spoke of strange noises and bursts of purple light at the mouth of the cave. Sounds like a worthwhile adventure! My friend is an aged fellow, so it may be nothing. It wouldn't be the first guar-chase I've been on since arriving here in Wrothgar. But I figure it's worth a look. I'll write to you soon to tell you what I found.",
