        "I carefully examined the ancient wards on this Ayleid chest after it was delivered to me. The spells of warding that have kept it sealed appear to be eroding. Likely, they will fade completely over time.",
        "Given the Ayleid propensity for devious traps, I deem it unwise to tamper with the chest any further. Perhaps a later scholar, armed with a deeper understanding of Ayleid culture and history, will be better prepared to deal with whatever is sealed within\u2014after the wards collapse."
