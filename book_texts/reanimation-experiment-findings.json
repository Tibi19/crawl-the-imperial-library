        "Common animals are proving an interesting challenge among our reanimators. Those with a lack of understanding of these beasts anatomy inevitably find their creations hobbled and deformed. While the remains are pliant, lacking the strong bonds between body and soul that more advanced beings possess, they are also mostly devoid of awareness, mindless puppets that must be directed with total concentration. A skillfully conducted ritual can produce undead with, at best, an instinct similar to that of the living counterpart. Regrettably, these creatures are often uncontrollably disturbed by their condition."
