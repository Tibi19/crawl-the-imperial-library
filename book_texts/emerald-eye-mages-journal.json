        "Lord Nabayir is determined that Mahtelah follow after her mother. He moved her to a suitably remote place, the Motalion Necropolis. No one will notice one more unusual tomb door unless they look closely, so we should not be disturbed. I have inscribed a map to the area for my own reference, as locating a specific door in this place is difficult at best.",
        "",
        "Mahtelah continues to be uncooperative. When not under the direct influence of the eye or my considerable persuasive skills, she still insists her name is Song and she continues to try to escape her confinement. I cast containment wards around the periphery, using her blood and drawing on the power of the dead within the necropolis itself. If she would only submit to the visions and the relic, her pain would ease.",
        "",
        "I will meet with Lord Nabayir to discuss our plans for the next ritual. It has been almost a week since Mahtelah's last vision. Whether she likes it or not, she will commune with the relic.",
        "",
        "She has no choice."
