        "There is no magic in the nightblade's repertoire more useful than the spell of instant translocation. Over time, its casting becomes almost a matter of reflex: one is HERE, and then, by an act of will, one is THERE.",
        "In fact, to the experienced practitioner, translocation becomes so routine that one almost forgets how difficult it was at first to learn. It is traditional to refer to this magical art as \"stepping through shadows,\" and indeed, the key to its mastery is the ability to \"peer sidewise\" and perceive the shadows cast by each entity and object in the Aurbis.",
        "These are not, of course, the literal shadows cast by the blockage of light by an opaque object, but the emanation of the limen each object possesses\u2014the depth-impression its existence makes in the local reality of the Mundus. This requires learning to focus the hyperagonal sense through which the practitioner perceives the flow of magicka. Once the nightblade can \"feel\" local transpontine deformation, it becomes almost trivial to make the transliminal saltation to any point within range."
