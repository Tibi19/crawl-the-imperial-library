        "Well, I'll have the last laugh. Taron may have my theory, but he doesn't have any proof, not yet. If I can find the Forge first, I can show the world this is my discovery. Mine, not his!",
        "4th of Last Seed\nI've got a lead. One of the moldy old books in Mzund mentioned the Forge. Ruined through and through, but I was able to copy down a few scraps, including a map of the first-era Dwemer kingdoms. Need to cross-reference it with modern borders when I get back.",

        "<bold>1 - Arkngthamz\nThis one, 'Arkngthamz', was on the inscription, too. Apparently the main Aetherium research center. Seems like the place to start.</bold>",
        "<bold>2 -\u00a0\nMentioned as a 'Bthar-zel' ('allied city'?). Not Bthardamz, though. Looks like a smaller site, north or northwest of there, on the river.</bold>",
        "<bold>3 -\u00a0\nThe primary source of Aetherium. Extracted from some deeper mine?</bold>",
        "<bold>4 -\u00a0\nA storage site for raw Aetherium, just outside a major city. Apparently, it had to be kept outside because the Aetherium was 'harmonically volatile'.</bold>",
        "<bold>5 -\nNo name, no identifying information, but page after page of ruined diagrams. Couldn't make out much, but it looks like - an astrolabe, a gear, some sort of crest in four pieces? Could this be the location of the Forge? Something important, at least.</bold>",

        "Couldn't find any clues, so I'll make a sketch and work through this carefully. Five Resonators. Five tones. Just have to hit them in the right order. Let's see...",
