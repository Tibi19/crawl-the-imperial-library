        "Most honored and revered leader, the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems,",
        "I am proud to report that the experiment worked even better than I anticipated. Thanks to your insightful suggestions, we have successfully spawned a composite creature. It features characteristics of a variety of predators, including scorpions, crocodiles, welwas, and humans. I call it the mantikora.",
        "As you suggested, combining the powdery nirncrux dust into the primeval spawning pools provided just the impetus we needed to quickly breed the composite creature. Now we have a single, powerful progenitor that we can use to create an army of mantikoras for the greater glory of the Serpent.",
        "We are already in the process of expanding the spawning pools to handle the increased productivity we hope to achieve. In addition, we have established a secondary set of pools where we plan to create more progenitors in the very near future. In the meantime, I look forward to showing you the fruits of our labor and introducing you to the progenitor when you can spare a moment to visit our operation.",
        "Yours in the Serpent's name,",
        "Boward, Regent of Wriggling Nightmares"
