        "Father tells me we must leave. There are bad people that say this place belongs to them, not us. I don't really understand. If this place is theirs, why are we living here? No one told me that it was someone else's home. It makes me sad to think about. I like living here, but father always says I shouldn't take things that aren't mine. Does it count when you didn't even know?",
