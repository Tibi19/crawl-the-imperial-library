        "through the doors of the unmourned house\nwhere scoffers scoff and schemers scheme\nfrom the halls of the oath-breaking house\nrings seven curses of gods blasphemed",
        "first curse, Curse-of-Fire\nsecond curse, Curse-of-Ash\nthird curse, Curse-of-Flesh\nfourth curse, Curse-of-Ghosts\nfifth curse, Curse-of-Seed\nsixth curse, Curse-of-Despair\nseventh curse, Curse-of-Dreams",
        "Notes",
        "Lines 1-3: Ambiguous. May refer to the impiety of the god-mocking House Dwemer, or the treacherous diplomacy of the subtle House Dagoth, or both. House Dagoth, however, was reviled as oath-breakers for their treachery at Red Mountain. It may, however, refer to unspecified broken oaths of peace between Lord Nerevar and Lord Dumac, founders of the Grand Council. Nerevar and Dumac were loyal friends until the disagreements between the Dwemer and the other Great Houses broke out in open conflict.",
        "Line 4: The Dwemer were the mockers and profaners of the divine.",
        "Lines 5-6: The curses of fire and ash would come from Red Mountain where Dagoth Ur rules. These were the earliest reported threats from Red Mountain.",
        "Line 7: Curse of flesh suggest blight diseases, especially corprus. The fire and ash storms preceded the threats of blight and corprus.",
        "Line 8-10: Obscure. May refer to as-yet-unrecognized threats from Dagoth Ur.",
        "Line 11: Recent reports of soul sickness and disturbed dreams come from townfolk and Ashlanders alike. That the seventh and final curse has begun suggests the threat presented is about to reach a crisis."
