        "Though the events of 2920 are largely fictional in nature, the seed of truth has borne fruit in the form of the Giovessen Skull. It is indeed the gold-dipped and gem-encrusted cranium of Tavia, famously imprisoned in Castle Giovesse at the behest of Emperor Reman III. Whispers that the Giovessen Skull is a false relic appear to have been spread by a previous owner in Hammerfell, no doubt to discourage the attempted theft of such a valuable piece of history.",
        "I hereby certify the Giovessen Skull as authentic. All rumors claiming the source skull was from a condemned Breton prisoner are just that - rumor.",
