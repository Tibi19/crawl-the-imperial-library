        "Rise from darkness, Red Mountain!\nSpread your dark clouds and green vapors!\nBirth earthquakes, shatter stones!\nFeed the winds with fire!\nFlay the tents of the tribes from the land!\nFeed the burned earth with our souls!",
        "Yet never shall you have your rule over me.\nNever shall I tremble or flinch from your power.\nNever shall I yield my home and hearth.\nAnd from my tears shall spring forth\nThe flowers of grassland springs."
