        "Where'ere I look, my darling Clarice,\nI think of you. A flock of geese,\nA lofty cloud, up in the skies,\nReminds me of your brownish eyes.\nWhen in the woods I see a fawn,\nI ponder on your hair of tawn.\nAcross the Iliac I sail\nIn every wave I never fail\nTo see you below, also above\u2014\nOh barmaid Clarice, please be my love!\nSinged,\nGeorges Plouffe, First-Mate (get it?)"
