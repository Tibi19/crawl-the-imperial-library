        "This one was, apparently, not clear enough in her directive against picking up travelers in passing, even if they offer gold! More travelers mean more attention, which is not a thing we seek. Some of the goods we transport are not held in the same high esteem as they are in our homeland.

        "This one assumes you understand now, yes?"
