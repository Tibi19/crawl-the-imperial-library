        "We're all now enemies of Colovia, and the beasts that inhabit this land aren't likely to be much more welcoming. Not that it would matter. I would rather be hung at home for deserting than cavort with talking housepets and cannibal tribes.",
        "The General sent us to die. She won't be able to hold what she's taken in Reaper's March, and most line soldiers are fully aware that this occupation will end in their deaths. We simply left.",
        "We've found some secluded ruins, ones that don't appear to hold much of value and aren't the carved mausoleums of the talking cats. We can lie low here until things quiet down, then pillage as we need from the beasts."
