        "I fear that there will always be a part of me that loves you. Perhaps that makes me a fool. And perhaps someone stronger or smarter than me would have left you sooner. Someone else might have seen you for what you really were before falling in love with you. But here I am instead. It has taken me too long to reach this point. I have suffered too much at your hands.",
        "What you've done to me, whether intended or not, is unforgivable. Worse yet, it does not seem to have made you come to your senses. I know these words will likely fall on deaf ears, but I will write them anyway. Your work has nothing to do with mercy or saving lives. You tamper with forces you can never understand, and they are corrupting you. That you could conduct such foul and profane rituals on unwilling subjects, on living people, is repulsive.",
        "Perhaps you've always known this. Have you been waiting for this? Do you willingly accept the monstrous thing you've become? I suppose it doesn't matter. If you're reading this, then I am already gone. Do not follow me, do not come looking for me.",
        "Make no mistake, Maxten, there is part of me that will always love you. I wish I could cut that part out. If I could set it aflame, I would.",
