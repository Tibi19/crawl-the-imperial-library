        "\u2014 Close-cover bodyguards. Every one is a Nord I trust implicitly. My son will be running the crew.\n\u2014 Disguise variety. We'll be able to offer you a different set of robes every day you're in the city. Hope you don't mind pretending to be a Priest of Mara.\n\u2014 Your damned food requests. Do you have any idea how much moon-sugar my chef requested to meet your menu requirements?\n\u2014 I've reluctantly agreed to host one of your men. This J'darzi has access to our network, and we'll accommodate him as best we can.",
