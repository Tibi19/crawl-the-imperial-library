        "The actions of Captain Usnagikh in opposing a raid by Abecean Pirates should be held in the highest of honors. Standing on the front line he emboldened his men to make a tactically decisive stand. Due to these efforts many civilians were withdrawn to safety and the enemy repelled. This defense was not without cost: Captain Usnagikh lost many of his troops, including two brothers.",
        "These efforts traditionally call for a meritorious field promotion; however, Captain Usnagikh has requested to be discharged from service. Taking into consideration Captain Usnagikh years of service and recent displays of valor, the commanding officers have granted Captain Usnagikh his request.",
        "Captain Usnagikh is hereby discharged with highest honors."
