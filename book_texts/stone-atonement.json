        "What deeper grief can a Khajiit suffer than witnessing a true cat's fall to Namiira? Watching the shining faces of brothers and sisters suddenly struck black as midnight\u2013creased with snarls of rage and sorrow. Our people curse the dro-m'Athra, but let us never forget that every dancing thrall of Namiira was once a pure child of Azurah, and an inheritor of the Ja-Kha'jay.",
        "No Khajiit is beyond redemption. By pressing the dro-m'Athra's souls into the bones of our fallen kin, we give them an opportunity for atonement. For the peace found only in twilight. So, pay no heed to those who shrink from our calls to the Dark. No price is too great for a soul made clean."
