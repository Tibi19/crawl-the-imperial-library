        "I know I'm going to die. They've already killed Father and Mother and everyone else. They'll find me soon. They're everywhere and I can't hide here forever. They'll see me or hear me or I'll fall asleep and roll off the ledge. I hope that's the way I go.",
        "Prefect Antias warned us. She said the Gray Vipers were coming, that scouts had been seen. She said they'd come for Mother's art collection. Father laughed, said he and the guards could protect us. We should have left, gone to Cropsford, let them have the art. They're just objects, not worth dying for. But they all did. And soon I will too.",
