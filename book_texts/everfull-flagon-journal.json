        "I would pray for a miracle, but who would listen to the prayers of a simple tavern owner who's down on his luck?",

        "An interesting fellow stopped by today. A mage of some sort, I think. Sat in a corner, kept his hood drawn over his features. At first, he was grim and kept to himself.

        "I can't wait to hear what he comes up with. I'd give anything to make this tavern successful.",

        "I made the bargain.\nThe Special Blend is as popular as promised.\nBusiness is booming, but at what cost?\nWhat have I done?"
