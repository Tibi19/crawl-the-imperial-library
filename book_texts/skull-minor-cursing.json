        "Now, we all have someone we do not like, yes? Not hate, of course, just someone who has done you a disservice perhaps. Wronged you in some way. You do not wish death upon them, but a little inconvenience? A little trouble? Well, this one has what you need!",
        "This Skull of Minor Cursing does it all. Severe foot fungus! Moderately uncomfortable nightmares! Incurable hiccups! Guaranteed to make your intended victim hopping mad. And for a fair price, too."
