        "I know that your ceaseless quest to appease and coddle the mortals takes a great deal of your time, but I must insist that you take a brief respite from your work to come visit the great castle we erected in your absence. It truly is magnificent. I firmly believe that when the peace we both seek is realized, Grayhome will stand among the wonders of the world. It will be a beacon of hope for our kind and the mortals who serve us. A grand reminder that anything is possible with hard work and vision.",

Come, my friend. Visit us at Grayhome. I've restocked your laboratory with everything you could ever need. I have no doubt that you and Exarch Tzinghalis can complete your research there.",
