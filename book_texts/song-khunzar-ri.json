        "(A Mythic Hero's Song)",
        "When the sixteen kingdoms were only sixteen tribes,\nA hero ambled forth, all tall and tough and wise,\nHow sleek he is! How fragrant! A five-claw? No, a ten!\nHe wrestles giants just for fun and charges into senche's den!",
        "CHORUS\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it loud, sing it clear. Fighter, lover, poet, thief.\nHe's one Khajiit to cheer!\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it proud, sing it strong! Brave and sly, rarely shy.\nHe never steers you wrong!",
        "No dungeon cage can hold him, no lock can bar his way,\nSome stories claim that he's a god, or so they say,\nHe dragged the light from Jone and Jode down to the growing fields,\nAnd now we have moon-sugar and all the good it yields.",
        "CHORUS\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it loud, sing it clear. Fighter, lover, poet, thief.\nHe's one Khajiit to cheer!\nWho is he? Khunzar-ri! Khunzar-ri!\nSing it proud, sing it strong! Brave and sly, rarely shy.\nHe never steers you wrong!"
