        "The feeble Lion Guard has left yet another fort abandoned and ripe for plunder. This one, called Cryptwatch Fort, is located near Crosswych. Your orders are simple: find the fort and turn it into a base of operations for the Red Rooks.",
        "What could be better than a fort we can move right into? It will help us further establish our presence in King's Guard, and it will provide another layer of protection in case the Bloodthorn Cult turns against us.",
        "Also, prepare for a meeting with Valenwe and her entourage. It would be good to add their unique skills to our cause."
