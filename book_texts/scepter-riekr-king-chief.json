        "A powerful riekr who refers to himself as \"the King-Chief\" currently terrorizes the land to the northeast of Orsinium. He wields an ancient scepter that the museum believes was crafted by Kloth, first chief of the Orgak Orc clan that once flourished in northern Wrothgar. It was a symbol of power and authority for the Orc clan and appears to be used in similar fashion by the self-styled king-chief.",
        "No Orsimer can rest while this historic relic remains in the hands of a lowly riekr\u2014no matter how powerful that lowly riekr may be."
