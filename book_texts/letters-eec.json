        "After reviewing your rather lengthy letter in which you've requested that the East Empire Company purchase your business on Solstheim, we must respectfully decline. The East Empire Company has been doing business in Tamriel for over five centuries, and in that time, we've had numerous business ventures. Some of those ventures have proven lucrative and some were highly unprofitable. The colony of Raven Rock belongs to the latter I'm afraid, and therefore we see no financial advantage in re-establishing any sort of business venture on Solstheim at this time.",

        "I felt I was rather clear in my last letter that the East Empire Company doesn't wish to engage in any sort of financial buyout of your business on Solstheim. We appreciate your enthusiasm, but the time just isn't right.",

        "We've received yet another letter from you requesting a buyout. At this time, I'm going to have to insist you cease any communication with the East Empire Company. There will be no further letters from me on this matter.",
