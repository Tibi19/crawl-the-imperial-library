        "The door to the Great Mooring, the linch-point of the Great Shackle, must remain locked while the magicka conduits draws energy from the living spark encased in the collection prism.",
        "The only way to open the door is to completely drain the energy from the living spark, or to disengage the conduits and cut off the flow of power.",
        "Never reverse the flow of energy through the conduits, however. Such a procedure could have disastrous effects on both the living spark and the energy collection apparatus, and it could set back the Planemeld by years, if not centuries, due to the amount of work that went into the system."
