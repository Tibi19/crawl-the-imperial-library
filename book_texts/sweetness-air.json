        "There has been a sweetness in the air since last week. Father says to pay no mind. There is nothing sweet here, has not been for a long time.",
        "I say it is well enough for him to say that since he's a grumpy old Orc. He remembers this village when it was a mining town. He thinks that every promise is poison, so if the air smells sweet it is a trick, foul magic.",
        "But I smell the sweetness, at night as I dream. A lover comes to me in the night, wrapped in honeysuckle and lavender. He is my wildflower prince. He promises to take me away from this backwater, this dead town.",
        "I think tonight I will go with him, if I can. I will go far away from here. But what if he doesn't appear in my dreams again? I don't even know his name."
