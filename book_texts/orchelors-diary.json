        "Two Days until the Handfast:\nThe Green Lady arrived! She challenged the Hound and he came \u2026 but he didn't come alone. At first, she looked angry, but then the Houndsmen witches started doing something. She seemed to get sleepy, but she didn't fall. The Hound caught her and they went up into the Throne Room!",
