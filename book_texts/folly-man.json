        "Listen 'round, I've a warning to sound,\nAbout an overgrown weed.\nAnd, I don't mean to forebode, but this little ode,\nIs a lesson you must heed.",
        "Now, our story unfolds, upon a pitiful mold,\nMade to thrive on rot.\nThis unsightly staph, was a trickster's last laugh,\nLong after his battle was fought.",
        "We called it the Sundering, in case you were wondering,\nWhen the heavens dropped out of the sky.\nThey hit with a thud, and gave birth to the mud,\nMaking up this mortal sty.",
        "It was a hell of a mess, but I digress,\nMy story's about the swine.\nWhat took root in this land, were seeds called Man,\nThat sprung up like fungus from grime.",
        "Their lives may be short, and lacking import,\nBut keep an eye to their blundering.\nIt's tempting to jest, about this simple pest,\nUntil you've seen their plundering.",
        "For when Men bound, to the Doom Drum's sound, You'll learn what the Corpse-God wrought.\nEven Trinimac didn't know, with his final blow,\nJust how badly he'd been caught."
