If the Skald-King is so curious about it, he should go have a look at it himself! Sorry. I know he means to keep us safe. I just wish he could do it without throwing you and the others into harm's way.",

You know how he gets when he reaches for the mead. At any rate, I spent the whole night thinking about it, and Haeralf, my sweet, I will marry you. To Sovngarde with my pa!",
