        "Sit, dear reader, have a care,\nAnd listen to wise Hennabear.\nI'll tell you things of Men and Mer,\nAnd all of them, you'll find, are fair.\nFirst I will of Dunmer speak,\nA culture old and quite unique.\nDark-skinned Elves of slight physique,\nTheir living gods' divine mystique.\nNext of Altmer you shall hear,\nNoble kin of highest tier.\nTheir icy words do not endear,\nBut speak no ill or you'll disappear.\nThe Redguard is the noble nomad,\nIn silks you'll often find them clad.\nThey carry sharp blades just in case,\nFast and skilled, you'll lose this race.\nIn forests Bosmer like to hide,\nFrom leaf to leaf like birds they glide.\nYou'll know at once when one has lied,\nHis lips will move when he's replied.\nThe burly Orc, slandered and green,\nProne to anger, not very serene.\nBelow the roughness one can glean\nA definite fondness for meaty cuisine.\nKhajiit: a large, smart, noble cat,\nSkilled in wordplay and mortal combat.\nThieves and pirates to be sure,\nBut the furred ones are so much more.\nBut now I see you're growing bored,\nPerhaps you'd like to hear of Nords?\nA people not to be ignored,\nForged in winter by axe and sword.\nArgonians are lizard men,\nWhose swamps contain their den.\nAsk a question, then ask again.\nWhat thoughts they have are beyond our ken.\nI'll finish with fine Breton tales,\nThis narrator's racial details.\nA people formed from harsh travails,\nBut hearty still, we yet prevail.\nNow, dear reader, you must swear,\nWhen you take these rhymes and share,\nTo ever credit Hennabear,\nFor if you don't\u2014he'll come! Beware!"
