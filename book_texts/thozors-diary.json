        "Entry 55\nThe Drublog won't let me in Dra'bul. They said I'm not Orc enough, that I spent too much time among the Bosmer. At least they let me set up a camp outside their gates.",
        "Entry 56\nDrublog bastards! There's a strangler not fifteen paces down the hill from where they told me to set up camp. I could have tripped over it last night.",
        "I didn't notice until this morning. Strange that it left me alone as I slept. It's not dead\u2014I can see it breathing. (Fluttering? Whatever it is they do.) I'll keep an eye on it. That thing moves and I'll fill it with arrows.",
        "Entry 57\nWoke up this morning to a monkey howling and carrying on. The little screecher tossed acorns at the strangler until it ran out.",
        "The strangler did nothing, not even flicker its tendrils. Why didn't it spit poison at that monkey?",
        "Entry 58\nThe monkey came back to throw more acorns. Still nothing from the strangler. Maybe it's docile.",
        "Entry 59\nGetting tired of that monkey.",
        "Entry 60\nI asked a Drublog about the strangler. He said it's called Gentle-Blossom. They told me to camp by it because it's harmless, but it scares off the senche-tigers. Not sure if I should believe him.",
        "Entry 61\nThe monkey threw an acorn at me. I put an arrow through its eye.",
        "I tossed the monkey's body next to Gentle-Blossom. I thought the fresh meat might rouse it\u2014him?\u2014but still nothing. Is he sick?",
        "Entry 62\nI stepped within five paces of Gentle-Blossom. Nothing.",
        "Entry 63\nThree paces today. Nothing. The Drublog was right, he's completely harmless.",
        "Entry 64\nI caught some game this morning. I think I'll try to share some with Gentle-Blossom. I'd really like to see what he looks like when he feeds."
