        "Faendal and Sven are competing for the affection of Camilla Valerius. The player can help either of them, delivering fake letters which makes the other look bad. The player can also tell Camilla about the rivalry and marry her himself.\n",

        "Dear Camilla,\nI know I have called upon you at your house many times, and while we may be growing close, I need you to put any desires you may have for me aside. I am a true-born son of Valenwood, and I could never befoul my bloodline by courting an Imperial. I hope we can remain true friends, provided you understand your people's place in the Aldmeri Dominion, and respect me as such.\nSincerely, Faendal"
