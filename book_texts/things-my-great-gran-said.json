        "My great-gran, who lived to a hundred and two, always had advice or offered a bit of lore for just about every occasion, every season, and every event in life\u2014hers or someone else's! Someone lost a leg in a battle? She said it was because he wed his wife during the first half of Sun's Dusk. A family made a bad investment and lost a lot of gold? That was because they had eleven cows, because everyone knows the number eleven is unlucky.",
        "Some of her other words of \"wisdom\" included:",
        "A lone mammoth on a hillside means a change is coming.\nTwo mammoths in the distance indicates that someone has a gift for you.\nThree mammoths in a line means an imminent death. (Not necessarily the viewer's. Unless, perhaps they decide to stand in front of the line of mammoths.)",
        "Never drink new mead on Morndas. (I think my great-gran may have made this one up to make sure her husband and sons sobered up in time for work.)",
        "If sizzling horker grease splashes on your face, you will get in a fight within three days. If it lands on your left hand, a visitor will soon appear.",
        "Slaying a bristleback boar when both moons are full leads to bad luck for the rest of the year. (My gran would never go hunting, nor would she let her husband and sons hunt, if the moons were full.)",
        "If the shadow of a hawk touches you during the month of Morning Star, it means winter will last longer.",
        "A white fox running east in the western hills at sunrise is a harbinger of a coming pestilence.",
        "If you do not settle a grievance with a relative or loved one during the first seven days of First Seed, a poor harvest will result.",
        "Finding a blue bead on the ground signals that a hagraven has just been created. Smashing the blue bead to dust with a rock and throwing the powder into still (not flowing) water will grant that hagraven a short life."
