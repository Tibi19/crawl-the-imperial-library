        "[This is a volume of verse collected from Ashlander wise women. 'May I shrink to dust' is from the Ahemmusa Ashlanders of the Grazelands.]",
        "May I shrink to dust\nIn your cold, wild Wastes,\nAnd may my tongue speak\nIts last hymn to your winds.",
        "I pray for the herder\nThat whistles to his guar at play.\nI pray for the hunter\nThat stalks the white walkers.\nI pray for the wise one\nThat seeks under the hill,\nAnd the wife who wishes\nFor one last touch of her dead child's hand.",
        "I will not pray for that which I've lost\nWhen my heart springs forth\nFrom your soil, like a seed,\nAnd blossoms anew beneath tomorrow's sun."
