        "",
        "A sacred flame rises above the fire,\nThe ghosts of great men and women without names,\nCities long dead rise and fall in the flame,\nThe Dioscori Song of Revelation,\nBursting walls and deathless rock,\nFiery sand that heals and destroys.\nAbove the sea Sentinel shines,\nHer domes agleam in the Iliac dawn.\nHer people throng the bazaars, and find\nTheir way between man's walls of stone.\nBut even in the towered town,\nSandals tread tracks in Alik'r sand.\nFor all those born of Redguard blood\nBring the wastes with them where e'er they go.\nThe desert grips our hearts and souls,\nIts flame within our eyes and ears.\nDust cannot die, and we are dust,\nWindblown, ephemeral, eternal, all."
