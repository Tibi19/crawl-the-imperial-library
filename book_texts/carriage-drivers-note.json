        "It happened sometime after we crossed deeper into the mountains, but I swear I could hear singing. Tuneless, very quiet, but singing nonetheless. No one else believes me, but I'd bet my bottom drake that it had something to do with the Dwarven machines attacking us last night. I've never heard of these things leaving their ruins, let alone roaming the countryside going after travelers. It's almost as if they were drawn to the music.",

        "Tonight we're handing the cargo off to the Sadras caravan, and I say good riddance. But the captain says we're going to eventually circle back to Whiterun, which means we could see the cargo again.",
        "",
        "If that happens, I'm getting off this caravan. I don't care about the gold. I haven't slept for days and I feel like I'm losing my mind.",
        "",
        "Even now, I can hear that awful singing in my head. I just want it to stop."
