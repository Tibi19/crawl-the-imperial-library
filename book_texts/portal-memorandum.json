        "I have received reports\u2014disturbing reports\u2014about the lack of defenses surrounding our portals. As you well know, allowing entry to Coldharbour could impede our Lord Molag Bal's plans. Should any of these disgusting provincials gain entry to all three, they might disrupt our pinions\u2014thus loosening our hold on the city. This cannot be allowed. I hereby order you to construct suitable defenses at all portal locations. Failure to do so will result in severe punishment.",
