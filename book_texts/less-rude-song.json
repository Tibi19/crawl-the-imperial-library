        "This song is an obvious sequel to Rude Song  in Daggerfall books.",
        "",
        "They say\nThe Iliac Bay\nIs the place to barrel around\nWithout a bit of apparel on,\nAs advertised in that carol song\nA tune that's sung as the west wind blows\nAbout it's lovely not wearing any clothes.\nLadies singing high notes, men singing lows,\nImplying that the most luscious depravity\nAnd complete absence of serious gravity\nCan only be found in the waterous cavity\nOf Iliac Bay.",
        "If you are the type who is more a sinner than a sinned,\nYou'll find it all in Morrowind.",
        "But the truth, my child,\nIs that nothing more wild\nThat an ordinary fashion\nKind of slightly mad passion\nCan be detected if at all\nIn Sentinel and Daggerfall.",
        "Whatever your odd needs: feathered, scaled, or finned,\nYou'll find it all in Morrowind",
        "It's an invention of bards\nThat Bretons and Redguards\nHave more than some staid fun\nAnd suffer deviant fornication.\nFor the most of madness, not the least,\nThe wise debaucher heads out east.",
        "Where your once steely reserve is now merely tinned,\nYou'll find it all in Morrowind.",
        "In Morrowind,\nThere is sin.\nBut, pray, do not confuse Dunmer variety\nWith that found in tepid Western society\nCompared to which, it nearly is piety.\nIt isn't terribly ingenious calling it prudery\nObserving the Dark Elf aversion to nudity.\nAfter all, the preferred sort of lewdity\nIn these parts is far more pernicious.\nFrom the Ashlanders to the wettest fishes\nYou'll find pleasure and pain quite delicious\nIn Morrowind.",
        "If you find yourself with unkind kinship with your kin\nYou'll find it all in Morrowind."
