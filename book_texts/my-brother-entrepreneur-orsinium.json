        "Brother,",
        "I hope this letter finds you well, for I know that we did not part on the best terms. When you got the invitation to Orsinium, I was adamant that you were on a fool's errand and insisted that you stay and help run father's business with me. When your first gift arrived, I nearly wrote you to tell you how wrong I was. The generous sack of gold saved the shop, and kept your brother-in-law and nieces fed for weeks.",
        "When your second gift arrived, I was intrigued. A curiosity, for sure! Those mudcrab-like legs. That adorable nose and furry back. I sold the cute little thing to a wealthy man, a traveler from Wayrest, who insisted that he must have it. He paid me a small fortune. Again, I nearly wrote you to tell you that I had been wrong all this time, but put it off.",
        "A few weeks later, I'm glad that I did.",
        "I smelled them before I saw them. The Wayrest man, with this monstrous crested beast in tow, shouted at be from across the counter at our stall. He demanded his money back, and more, for this thing eating all of his fine silk shirts. Apparently this monster, now the size of a large tusked bull, liked to butt up against the supports of the man's house, and nearly knocked it down.",
        "Lucky for me, the magistrate found in my favor. \"Let the buyer beware.\"",
        "Whatever this beast is, you are a fool for sending one to me. Please do not send another.",
        "Love and kisses, Sis",
        "P.S. You may continue to send gold."
