        "In order for the Penitus Oculatus to ensure the safety of our honored Emperor during his visit to Skyrim, we must personally verify the security of every city in the province. To this end, I appoint you my personal representative, granting all rights and privileges afforded a commanding officer of the Penitus Oculatus. You are authorized to speak with my voice, and administer with my hand.",
        "Gaius, I cannot do this alone. There is much work to be done here in Dragon Bridge and elsewhere, and many arrangements still to be made before the Emperor's arrival. I simply cannot afford to spend time traveling right now. But you must know the seriousness of the task I set before you. When he arrives, the Emperor may choose to visit any city in Skyrim, as suits his whim. If he does so, we, the Penitus Oculatus, must be sure that security within those cities is sufficient to deal with any threat to his person that may arise.",
        "Gaius, my beloved son - you may be new to the Penitus Oculatus, but I need someone I can trust. You must carry out your duty, for the safety of the Emperor, the glory of the Penitus Oculatus, and the honor of the Maro family name.",
        "Your superior officer (and loving father),",
