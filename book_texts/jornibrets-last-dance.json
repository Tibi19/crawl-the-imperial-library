        "Women's Verse I:\nEvery winter season,\nExcept for the reason\nOf one war or another\n(Really quite a bother),\nThe Queen of Rimmen and her consort\nRequest their vassals come and cavort.\nOn each and every ball,\nThe first man at the Hall\nIs Lord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer,\nThe Curse of all the Maidens Fair.",
        "Women's Refrain:\nOh, dear ladies, beware.\nDearest, dearest ladies, take care.\nThough he's a very handsome man,\nIf you dare to take his handsome hand,\nThe nasty little spell will be cast\nAnd your first dance with him will be the last.",
        "Men's Verse I:\nAt this social event\nEveryone who went\nKnew the bows and stances\nAnd steps to all the dances.\nThe Queen of Rimmen and her consort\nWould order a trumpet's wild report,\nAnd there could be no indecision\nAs the revelers took position.\nThe first dance only ladies, separate\nAway from such men as Lord Jornibret.",
        "Men's Refrain:\nOh, dear fellows, explain.\nBrothers, can you help make it plain:\nThe man's been doing this for years,\nLeaving maidens fair in tears\nBefore the final tune's been blast.\nAnd her first dance with him will be the last.",
        "Women's Verse II:\nLord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer\nWatched the ladies dance on air\nThe loveliest in the realm.\nA fellow in a ursine-hide helm\nSaid, \"The Queen of Rimmen and her consort\nHave put together quite a sport.\nWhich lady fair do you prefer?\"\nLord Jornibret pointed, \"Her.\nSee that bosom bob and weave.\nWell-suited for me to love and leave.\"",
        "Women's Refrain.",
        "Men's Verse II:\nThe man in the mask of a bear\nHad left the Lord of Gaer\nBefore the ladies' dance was ending.\nThen a trumpet sounded, portending\nThat the Queen of Rimmen and her consort\nCalled for the men to come to court.\nDisdainful, passing over all the rest,\nOgin approached she of bobbing breast.\nShe was rejected, saved a life of woe,\nFor a new maiden as fair as snow.",
        "Men's Refrain.",
        "Women's Verse III:\nAt the first note of the band,\nThe beauty took Ogin's hand.\nShe complimented his stately carriage\nDancing to the tune about the marriage\nOf the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.\nIt is very difficult indeed to comport\nWith grace, neither falling nor flailing,\nWearing ornate hide and leather mailing,\nDancing light as the sweetest of dreams\nWithout a single squeak of the seams.",
        "Women's Refrain.",
        "Men's Verse III:\nThe rhythms rose and fell\nNo one dancing could excel\nWith masculine grace and syncopation,\nLord Jornibret even drew admiration\nFrom the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.\nLike a beauteous vessel pulling into port,\nHe silently slid, belying the leather's weight.\nShe whispered girlishly, \"The hour is late,\nBut I've never seen such grace in hide armor.\"\nIt 'twas a pity he knew he had to harm her.",
        "Men's Refrain",
        "Women's Verse IV\nThe tune beat was furious\nHe began to be curious\nWhere had the maiden been sequest'ed.\n\"Before this dance was requested\nBy the consort and his Queen of Rimmen\nI didn't see you dance with the women.\"\n\"My dress was torn as I came to the dance,\"\nShe said smiling in a voice deep as a man's,\n\"My maids worked quickly to repair,\nWhile I wore a suit of hide, a helm of a bear.\"",
