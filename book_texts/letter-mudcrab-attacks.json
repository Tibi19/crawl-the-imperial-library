        "One traveler said that they \"jumped out of the sea right at her.\" I would like you, the foremost expert on mudcrab, to investigate. I cannot afford to spare any of my guards, so I ask you, please find a way to rid these beasts from our shores!",

        "Viriya's notes: Fascinating. I wonder what could be causing them to gather together and become aggressive? Mudcrab are timid creatures unless threatened, so something must have stirred them up. Either way, they will have to be put to rest so the shore is safe again. A shame I won't get a chance to study them."
