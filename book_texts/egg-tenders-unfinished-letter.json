        "I should have taken you up on your offer, egg-sister. Even that little smudge of a trading post would be a welcome escape from all the fuss at home. Things are more frantic than usual this year and it seems as though all eyes are upon the egg-tenders. I've barely had a minute's peace to think, let alone put quill to paper. Perhaps things will settle down when you return with supplies for the ceremony. I hope you return soon. You know what wonders a sympathetic ear does for my mood. It's not like I can confide in the other egg-tenders.",

        "There's some sort of commotion going on out by the tree-minder's. Let's hope it's not more trouble for me."
