        "When I first entered the great chamber, I was there again, in the High Chapel, nestled in her glow.",
        "",
        "Great pillars surrounded the stone where the Goddess Almalexia once stood. As if it were washed in the fire, Mournhold had shed its skin to reveal a temple of rock and bone.",
        "",
        "I knew then that this stone was the heart of our Goddess. And through faith, love, and sweat, we have slowly restored Her flesh.",
        "",
        "Now that she is almost complete, my thoughts turn to my old friend, Erden Relvel. He was the Diviner whose scrying brought us to this holy place. Without him, none of this would be possible. Yet time and toil changed him, to the point I questioned his devotion. Wherever he is, I hope he has regained his love for Her.",
        "",
        "Regardless, our work does not end there. With Her Hands to guide me, we will rid this world of her dissidents. We will reunite the fires of hope and truth under Her banner and theirs, and let the light of ALMSIVI shine on servants and apostates alike."
