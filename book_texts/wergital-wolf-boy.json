        "Kynareth watched from the rain, clouds, and skies\nA Breton child cloaked in a furry disguise\nNurtured by wolves of the Glenumbra glen\nA wolf-boy would scamper through woods, hills, and fen\nCutting his teeth on the flesh of the hunt\nHe grew brawn and bone, no longer the runt\nNight hunts for prey in the light of Secunda\nThe pack grew more daring to forage and plunder",
        "Fell's Run farmers, their hairs stood on end\nFlitting dark shapes, t'was a violent portend\nBringing down cattle with ravenous snarl\nA predator child with the wolves in his thrall\nHunters dispatched, with pelts their desire\nThe wolves they did flee, all safe in the briar\nMore daring the wolf raids, encroaching the town\nSo elders did plan to bring the pack down",
        "A goat tied and bleating, intended as bait\nLured wolf-boy and pack to a terrible fate\nThe pack leapt at prey, intending a meal\nBut the archers of Fell's Run soon brought them to heel\nArrows flew fast as the boy dropped his cowl\nBloodied and pierced, he fell with a howl\nWergital Wolf-Boy was burned on the moor\nReturn unto Kynareth\u2014your soul is now pure"
