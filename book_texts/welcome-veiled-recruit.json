        "Recruit! You're only going to get one chance to get this right. Slip up and you're out!\n\u2014 Tell no one of the Veiled Keep, or our training grounds on the island.\n\u2014 Recognition phrases change every two days. Learn to memorize these phrases as if your life depended on them. It does.\n\u2014 At all times, keep your gear in good order. Alandare in particular hates a sloppy uniform. Keep it clean. Keep your blade sharp.\n\u2014 Try not to strut in front of the servile scum in Skywatch. Their day will come, but we must be patient."
