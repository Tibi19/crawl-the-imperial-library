        "To open the gate in our mysterious lake,\nOne must follow the book of teachings.\nFor only when shapes are set and directions followed,\nWill the portal open\u2014but try not to get swallowed.",
        "Let the Sun's spiky rays warm the Northern shore,\nAs Masser's Full Moon rises in the Western expanse,\nAnd Aetherius' Star sparkles above the Eastern moor,\nWhile the Crescent Moon of Secundus fills the Southern glance."
