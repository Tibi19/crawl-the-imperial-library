        "(A Khajiiti Love Song)",
        "CHORUS\nThis one weaves a song\nHe'll sing it to you all day long\nWill you love him? Will you love him?",
        "He'll steal a thousand jewels\nHe'll even play the fool\nSay you love him. Say you love him.",
        "Well, your mother will never give her blessing, true\nBut let's be honest dear\nThat's what you want to hear",
        "No, this one will never buy you Mara's ring\nBut under the starlight\nYou can grasp him tight",
        "CHORUS\nThis one weaves a song\nHe'll sing it to you all day long\nWill you love him? Will you love him?",
        "So many sweetmeats this one could woo\nBut it's you that he needs\nOh, he begs and pleads",
        "In the moonlight he will worship you\nBut come the morning sun\nHe will most definitely run!",
        "CHORUS\nThis one weaves a song\nHe'll sing it to you all day long\nWill you love him? Will you love him?"
