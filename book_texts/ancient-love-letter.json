        "My Dearest Aconia,\nMy heart is chill as the winter's blight\nAs I stand here in blackest night\nYou I know can be the only one\nTo bring me back into the sun.\nThe waves they crash upon the beach\nBut it is to you that I beseech\nCall me back to your warm embrace\nAnd across time and distance I shall race\nThe last embers flicker in the flame of war\nLet all be as it was once before\nNe'er again shall I sail away\nMy heart with you will always stay.\nYour beloved,\nRogano\nCenturion, 33rd Cohort, 2nd Legion"
