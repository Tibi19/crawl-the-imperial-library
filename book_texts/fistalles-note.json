        "One day, a great big kitty with a tawny hide was playing with a little bag. The cat poked his head into the bag. He was a very nosy, hungry cat. He was hoping to find food in the bag.",
        "Instead he found two rats hiding inside! One of them bore a blade, and its head was covered in silk. The other wore a veil, and hissed in annoyance.",
        "The cat realized that the only way he could get these rats out of this bag was to let in more light. Under the light, the rats would be forced to fight or flee."
