Pa doesn't like Ma's flowers or her bottles of goopy stuff. I don't like the goopy stuff either, but it does make me feel better when I'm sick, so I guess it's okay.",

        "I can't wait till I'm old enough to join the Legion and get away from the farm. I've been practicing every day with my sword - I think I'm good enough to be a captain, or even a general! But Pa doesn't want me to join the Legion cause he says I have to take over the farm when I'm old enough. Ma doesn't want me to go cause it's dangerous. That's about the only thing they agree on.",

        "I bet if I defeated a bandit or killed a wolf or something that would show them! Then they would have to let me join up with the Legion.",

        "Pa always tells me to stay away from the old well, the one toward the tall monument, out by the tree sitting on a rock. Wolves like to hunt out there, he says. So that's where I'll go. I'll kill a wolf and bring home its head, and that'll prove I'm a man and not a baby.",
