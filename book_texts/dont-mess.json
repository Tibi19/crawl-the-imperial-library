        "Our friends from the Gold Coast will be arriving with their shipment at midnight.",
        "Some of the goods will be fragile. Part of the shipment will be alive. You already know that if anything breaks, gets hurt, or dies, you're paying us back out of your share. Apparently, we have to tell you again.",
        "In the future, we would also like these shipments scheduled at a time other than midnight. That's not exactly discreet. In fact, it's rather predictable. Guards catch people who are predictable.",
        "I also sincerely hope you're actually reading our letters and then burning them. You're getting careless. We don't want to leave any evidence behind. You stand to make a lot of coin, as long as you don't mess this up.\nDon't mess this up."
