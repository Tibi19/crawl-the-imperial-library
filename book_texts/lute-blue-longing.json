        "This instrument belonged to the cursed bard Gjaldred. While playing at the court of the East Kingdom, the queen became smitten with the handsome bard. Callously, he composed a tender ballad to seduce her. So believing he loved her, the queen dismissed her guards and Gjaldred came to her chamber.",
        "Before dawn, his pleasure done, the faithless bard slipped away and fled the castle. Realizing she had been cruelly deceived, the queen took her own life after laying a fearsome curse upon Gjaldred. It compelled him to sing the song of his treachery as her spirit appeared whenever he took up his lute.",
        "Even today, the queen's spirit can sometimes be seen when love songs are played on the lute."
