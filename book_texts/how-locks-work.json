        "I have to scribble this down before they wipe my memory again.",
        "I figured out how some of the locks in this room work. At least, I think I have the basics worked out. The door is locked by some kind of mechanism that must receive a charge from the various tubes and pipes that run along the wall.",
        "But the tubes and pipes are cold now. If I could find some sort of power source to provide them with energy, I might be able to activate them long enough to open the gate and get out of this nightmare.",
        "I hear them returning. I'm hiding this up here. Maybe if I'm stuck back in this room I'll stumble upon it again and unlock more of this damned puzzle.",
        "At least I can hope, right?"
