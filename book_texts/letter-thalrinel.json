        "My Dearest Thalrinel,",
        "I write to you in the hope that I find you in good health and good spirits. You will need both in the days and weeks to come.",
        "I know you were not looking for this much excitement so early in your tenure as Treethane of Silvenar, but the gods challenge us to make us stronger, not to make us more comfortable.",
        "Certainly the deaths of Finoriell and her silvenar caught us all by surprise. Some say it's the price we pay for joining the Aldmeri Dominion and involving ourselves in the upheaval of Khenarthi's Roost.",
        "I've even heard a few grumblings against the queen, and the Khajiit in general.",
        "You must not let this discontent show at the handfast! I saw your invitation list, and you did exactly what you needed to do. Members of all the Dominion races have been invited and, should they attend, we must treat them as close friends.",
        "If we are to stand against the growing darkness, we must join hands to know who our allies truly are.\nAll my best,\n\u2014 E."
