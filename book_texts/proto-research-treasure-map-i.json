        "My research indicates that a cache of Ayleid relics lays somewhere in the village of Craftland. Numerous ancient writings speak of the \"tall tan-toned spire\" that \"sits aside the wall\".",
        "However, I have been unable to gain enough funding for a research expedition to the area to investigate further. The deacon is concerned about the threat posed by one bandit lord Dezanu. Poppycock, I say! No mere toll-stealer will stop the march of progress!",
        "I intend to set out shortly on my own to find this cache myself. I am certain that this is a solid and well-thought-out plan, and that no sudden or inevitable misfortune shall befall me."
