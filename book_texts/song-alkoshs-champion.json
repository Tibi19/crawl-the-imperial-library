        "Khenarthi's winds will guide me\nTo brave the path with pride\nLorkhaj's steps will bind me\nTo follow in his stride.\nAlkosh will purify me\nTo mend the sands of time\nHis mask will sanctify me\nA champion of pride.",
        "I ride the winds cunningly\nAnd never break my stride\nI face the darkness valiantly\nThe lanterns are my guide.",
