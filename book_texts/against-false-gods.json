        "Fear not the False Gods, for their very presence is a lie.\nAbducted power ripped from artifacts undeserving.\nWorship received from mindless cattle doing what they're told.\nYou bow to them not out of reverence. Not out of respect.\nYou bow to them out of fear. Out of unknown truths left untold.\nBut why? Because it is right? Because it is what is expected of you?\nThe people of this land bathe in the filth of corruption and deceit. A filth of their own making.\nWe will give them the cure, all the blind and tainted.\nWe will show them that their gods are not as powerful as they believe.\nThe Maulborn will rise to purify this land in the true image of the Princes.\nTo cleanse this soil of all falsehoods.\nMay the Three feel our wrath. May the Three be cleansed of their lies.\nFor the Maulborn shall bring forth a reckoning."
