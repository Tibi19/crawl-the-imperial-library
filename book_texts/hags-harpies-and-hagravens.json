        "So listened I to a sermon by the thrice-honorable High Priest Zuladr of the High Temple. And he did inveigh against womanhood and its inherent wickedness, citing the Tale of the Temptress Shakhari, and the bloody crimes of Queen Jezerei. \"Consider hags, harpies, and hagravens,\" quoth he. \"Are these monsters not all, each and every one, women\u2014and therefore wicked?\"",
        "And I thought to myself, \"It seems to me this is a priest who likes not women. Wherefore?\"",
        "Wherefore? And wherein, if women are wicked, does he find the virtues of men, which he infers as a corollary? Was not the Grandee Kwarizm, who basely slew his thirteen wives, a man? Are not the terrible ogres of the hills and the giants of the mountains always male? Consider the legendary minotaur\u2014is he not even excessively male?",
        "Was not Sep the God-Deceiver a male?",
        "So called I then upon the thrice-honorable High Priest Zuladr in his quarters and spake this to him, but he was unabashed, and called me immodest and presumptuous. \"Yes, I presume,\" I said, \"and I shall presume further.\" And I unveiled my features, and disrobed my form, and said, \"Is this the wickedness you fear, O holy priest?\"",
        "And the priest did shake, and perspire, and reach for me with fingers avid and trembling. But I struck them aside with a laugh, and resumed my garments. And I said unto him, \"Consider, O priest, that a true woman gives not her gifts to one who does not respect them.\"",
        "And thus did I deliver a sermon unto the high priest."
