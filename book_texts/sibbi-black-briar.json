        "A quick note regarding my son, Sibbi. He's to be treated as I'd expect you to treat any one of the Black-Briar family and all of his requests are to be honored without question. However, if he wishes to be released, you are not to do so unless I expressly authorize it. Sibbi needs to learn his place, and the only way that will happen is if he's kept under lock and key.",
