        "Excerpt from The Book of the Warrior God: 3:24\u2014Avalian's Flight",
        "And the volcano erupted with a thunderous boom. The ground rattled and the sky filled with ash. This did not break Avalian's will. He stared at his enemy\u2014a fiery god of lava and stone. His blade drawn, Trinimac's blessed child Avalian charged the mountain. Though lava flowed and covered the path, Avalian traversed the mountain with such quickness that the heat did not scorch his feet. As quick as the wind, Avalian dove into the mountain, driving his blade into the heart of the beast."
