        "\"We must warn Awas. The Kothringi are nearly upon us!\"",
        "The two Argonians exchanged glances, the movement of their dark eyes a mere flicker of light in the shadows.\n\"I'll go,\" hissed Sanax, and slipped into the murky waters.",
        "Juunei followed her slow progress. Fires burned at the swamp's edge, creating a thick smoke only Argonian eyes could pierce.",
        "Or so he thought. Axes glinted and slashed. Juunei heard a strangled cry, then nothing. Who knew the clumsy dryskins could move so silently?",
        "Juunei swore an oath and eyed the dirt path to the xanmeer. It was longer and exposed. But he had to warn Awas.",
        "They chased Juunei down the path, slashing and stabbing, but they made little noise. He was in sight of the xanmeer's stone edifice when something grabbed his tail, pulling him to the ground.",
        "A Kothringi thug raised her dirty axe to finish him off. He cried out. Then a hurled Kothringi knife buried itself in the thug's throat.",
        "Awas emerged from the muck. She retrieved the knife and helped Juunei to his feet.",
        "\"How did you know?\" gasped Juunei, nodding at the Kothringi knife.",
        "\"A lesson from the dreams of the Hist,\" murmured Awas. \"To truly understand a foe, fight them with their own weapons.\"",
        "Juunei stared at Awas, then grabbed the dead Kothringi's axe. They hurried to the xanmeer."
