        "I look forward to our next meeting. I have always enjoyed our working relationship, and I am ever so grateful that you have agreed to allow us to use the secret chambers beneath your estate for a conversation that needs to remain extremely private.",
        "Our guests should arrive promptly by the usual means. Please make sure they are comfortable and see to their every need until I make my appearance - fashionably late, of course!",
        "And do try to make sure that Count Carolus and the Primate don't throttle each other senseless before I arrive. We have important business to deal with and I need them both focused on the issues at hand. I don't know how they accomplish anything in Kvatch, the way those two constantly snipe at each other.",
        "Oh, and on your way down, why don't you bring me a bottle of your family's best wine? You do have to pass by that way, after all.",
