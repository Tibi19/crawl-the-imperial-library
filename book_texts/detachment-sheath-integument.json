        "Although the book's title in game, when the cursor is on it, is simply \"On the Detachment of the Sheath,\" it lists the full title at the beginning of the text itself.",

        "Though all given Concavities, or sheathes within the integument of the Aurbis, are necessarily contained by the Aurbis, Right Reaching dictates that a defined sheath may be detached from the integument by invocation of Mnemoli. Upon intercourse with the star-orphan, the Beseeching Alesstic performs eversion of the organ of thought, an employment of the Hurling Disk that recapitulates the truth that a circle turned sidewise is a Tower. BY the same-truth, twisting the enveloping sheath into the middle dawn (to the number of seventeen) brings it to untime and unplace.",
