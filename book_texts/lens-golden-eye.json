        "Shunned by most of the crude and ignorant Daedric Princes, the Golden Eye cares little for caprice and whimsy.",
        "While the likes of Clavicus Vile and Boethiah scheme and meddle, the Golden Eye watches. When mad Sheogorath, in his eternal dementia, wastes his power on folly, the Golden Eye meticiously documents his mania.",
        "Give praise to him! Devote your energy, your mind, your soul to Hermaeus Mora! In doing so, your name will be more than a mere footnote in the endless libraries of Apocrypha.",
        "When your flesh is no more, may he grant you admittance into his hall of all knowledge, so that you may thirst for it nevermore."
