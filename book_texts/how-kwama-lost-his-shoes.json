        "In the ash and sand of Stoneyfalls\nthe little kwama lost his way\nHe hurps and durps, to his mother calls\nbut the volcanoes do not sway.\nThe Forager passed him\nburbling then, with sand and skrit upon his back\nHe tripped and lost his front-right shoe\nand wished he'd brought some kind of snack.\nThe Worker rawped him\nchiding then, angry at the loss of time\nHe tripped and lost his back-left shoe\nand skittered legs-past, up to climb.\nThe Warrior snarled him\nfighting then, bites and snaps at nasty shalk\nHe tripped and lost both-other-shoes\navoiding monsters, things that stalk.\nThe Queen found him then\ncries and leaks all down his face\nShe cracked his chitin for those lost shoes\nand ate him squealing for his disgrace."
