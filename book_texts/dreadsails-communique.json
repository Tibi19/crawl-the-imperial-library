        "Note that sailing near Amenos is extremely treacherous. Breton patrols and well-hidden shoals demand absolute precision from your helmsmer and all sailors. The sea lord suggests mooring in Skulltooth Cove on the northwestern shore of the island. It's a popular haunt for more daring privateers and smugglers. Take as a prize any ships you find there and remain hidden until additional orders reach you.",
