        "As the hammer fell, Vaia stood her ground. Rhogar the Destroyer had shattered entire armies with the power of his enchanted hammer. But this did not dampen Vaia's resolve. Holding her shield above her head, she knew that Trinimac watched over her. A loud crash, a thunderous boom, and a crack that toppled nearby trees echoed throughout the land. But when the dust settled, it was not the small wooden shield that Vaia held that lay shattered on the ground. It was Rhogar's mighty hammer."
