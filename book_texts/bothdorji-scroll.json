        "Breathe candent smoke on the veil of Oblivion\nAnd force the line dispelled\nAwaken the sleepless, unquiet Princes\nAnd bid Their standing servants rise\nIt is the night when frost will burn\nWhen flame will freeze the lamplit lake\nWhen clouds of bats devour clouds of birds\nWhen boils and sores afflict the rich\nWhen a boy with wings doth curse the land\nIf knowing lies fester on my tongue\nAnd such whens are but whispers in the night\nThese words form a sentence of death\nBut if the Day of Oblivion is indeed at hand\nServants of the Dark, obey me"
