        "Sera Arthalen\u2014My Dear Tidyn,",
        "I am deeply saddened by your response to my most recent correspondence. Know that a great storm approaches, Sera. Your precious Selfora will not avoid its rage. A time comes when you must choose sides. It is inevitable. I do not recommend you oppose me when the line is drawn.",
        "I shall be visiting Selfora in the very near future. We must discuss this matter personally. Exchanging letters can be so impersonal, and often the true meaning of our words is lost in translation. I want to make sure we truly understand each other.",
        "I suggest you prepare for my imminent arrival.",
