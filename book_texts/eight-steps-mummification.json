        "\u2014 Step the First: Consecrate the body with the Blessings of Tu'whacca.\n\u2014 Step the Second: Remove all internal organs before they can decay, causing unsightly stains.\n\u2014 Step the Third: Remove all brain tissue. This is to be done through the nostrils using the hook-spoons, so as to avoid damaging the skin of face and head.\n\u2014 Step the Fourth: Dehydrate the body by coating it in parch-salt, and placing packets of parch-salt within its cavities.\n\u2014 Step the Fifth: Replace lost volume within the body with inert material, paying special attention to restoring the features of the face.\n\u2014 Step the Sixth: The layers of wrapping: wrap the body in one hundred paces of linen, then coat the linen with warm juniper resin. Do this three times.\n\u2014 Step the Seventh: The adorning of amulets: array the body in amulets and bracelets that represent the station of the body in life.\n\u2014 Step the Eighth: Place the body in a prepared sarcophagus. Proceed to burial in the necropolis."
