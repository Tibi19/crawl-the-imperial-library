        "About the doll. Toss the thing out of Dragonhome. Kick it off the face of a cliff, for all I care. That miserable woman will spend eternity stuffed with hay for daring to challenge us. I really don't care what you do with it, just get it out of my sight.",
        "We need to be more careful about our supply routes, and remember that there are eyes and ears everywhere. We cannot risk leading anyone else back to Dragonhome. Hiding among the shadows until we are strong enough to be a true threat is the only way to ensure our success."
