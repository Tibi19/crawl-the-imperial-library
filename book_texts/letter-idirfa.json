        "Sorry for the delay in sending you this letter. I know it might not get delivered for a while, but I wanted to let you know I've had some success. It's been a long journey, but I know it's going to be worth it.",
        "The weather turned bad and we were forced to take shelter in Icehammer's Vault. Not as ideal as a nice warm inn, but at least I can look for some treasure while we're here. As long as I'm quick and quiet, I think I can find some gold and maybe a relic or two.",
        "The wife is not happy with the situation, of course, but she is patient and understanding. She brought a few books and she's reading to the baby. She prefers religious tomes, but if that's what it takes for her to get through this, that's fine with me.",
        "I don't feel good about bringing my family here, but you know how those moneylenders are. I actually feel safer with the family beside me than back in Windhelm where they might get harassed.",
        "We'll return to Fort Amol as soon as we've got enough to pay off my debts. May the Divines watch over you. May they guide and protect us all.\n\u2014 Uggissar"
