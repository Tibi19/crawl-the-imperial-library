        "Rejoice, peoples of northwest Tamriel! Though the rest of Nirn is afflicted by war, madness, and Daedric horror, the glory and honor of the Reman Empire lives on in the Daggerfall Covenant. We remain true to the primacy of trade, the principles of freedom, and worship of the Divines.",
        "In the face of a world of enemies, the trade powers of the Iliac Bay have formed a powerful alliance. High Rock, Hammerfell, and Orsinium stand as one, united under the rule of the High King in Wayrest. Orc and Breton craftsmanship make the alliance an economic powerhouse, and the military strength of the Orcs and Redguards make us a force to be reckoned with. Our kings join our people in longing for the return of a Tamrielic Empire, along with the economic prosperity that goes with it. There is only one way to make sure the right Emperor rules once more from the Imperial City: we must attend to it ourselves.",
        "The current so-called \"Empire of Cyrodiil\" is a sham, a twisted mockery of Reman's glorious Second Empire. The charlatans who sit on the Ruby Throne openly mock the Divines and court the Lords of Oblivion, the Enemies of Man. Even the once-promising Emperor Varen fell victim to Daedric corruption, his reforms swept away by the puppet-masters of the Daedric Cabal.",
        "The Daggerfall Covenant is the only true heir to the principles of the Second Empire. In the name of the Divines, we must conquer Cyrodiil and restore the glory of Reman's legacy. The cancerous Daedra worship that has corrupted Cyrodiil and threatens all Nirn shall be cleansed from Tamriel. We shall found the Tamriel Covenant, that all kingdoms may have a seat at the Grand Council under a new Imperial Dynasty.",
        "Forward, soldiers of the Covenant! Freedom for all peoples in the name of the Divines! For a new Empire and a new era of law and justice!"
