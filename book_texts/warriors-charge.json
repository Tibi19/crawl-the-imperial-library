        "\nThe star sung far-flung tales\nWreathed in the silver of Yokuda fair,\nOf a Warrior who, arrayed in hue sails\nHis charges through the serpent's snare",
        "And the Lord of runes, so bored so soon,\nLeaves the ship for an evening's dare,\nPerchance to wake, the coiled snake,\nTo take its shirt of scales to wear",
        "And the Lady East, who e'ery beast,\nAsleep or a'prowl can rouse a scare,\nScreams as her eye, alight in the sky\nA worm no goodly sight can bear",
        "And the mailed Steed, ajoins the deed\nNot to be undone from his worthy share,\nRides the night, towards scale bright,\nLeaving the seasoned Warrior's care",
        "Then the serpent rose, and made stead to close,\nThe targets lay plain and there,\nBut the Warrior's blade the Snake unmade,\nAnd the charges wander no more, they swear",
