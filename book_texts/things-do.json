        "1. Repair holes in nets. Sending to Markarth too expensive, look for local solution. Valindor perhaps?",
        "2. Repair wood damage on fish pens. No skill required for this, should simply have Wujeeta take care of it.",
        "3. Adjust fishing charts for Lake Honrich. Need to keep ship clear of Goldenglow Estate. They took potshots at our ship last time we moored within a stone's throw of their location, no idea why and answers to Aringoth have gone unanswered.",
        "4. Tell Nivenor to stop spending so much of our damn money!",
