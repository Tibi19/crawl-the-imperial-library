        "This is my last warning to you. Not only have you refused to let me inspect your research notes, it's come to the point where I've been barred from your presence entirely! If you're going to degrade me to passing along notes, as if we were school children in a tiff, then I have no qualms tattling on your little operation. I'm sure that House Hlaalu would like to know about the risk you now pose to the native kwama population and your consistent refusal to see reason.",
        "I give you a final choice, out of my respect for you. You can either cease this madness at once, or I'll be forced to act,",
        "I expect your reply shortly and in person.",
