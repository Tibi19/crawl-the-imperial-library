        "I've planted the seeds of the Drinkers. Soon I shall know if my theories hold true.",
        "The first shoots have appeared. I must make sure to continue the precise schedule of nutrient solutions.",
        "Small Drinker fronds are clearly visible. This is a critical time in their development. I'm almost out of rat blood. I'll have to catch some more of the filthy beggars.",
        "The young plants are juveniles now. I can see them waving as if in a breeze, although the air in my cellar is still as death.",
        "I'm having a hard time catching any more cats. I may have to start using dogs. The damn Drinker plants have a voracious appetite.",
        "One of them cut me today. I'll have to be more careful.",
        "My creations are refusing to feed. As an experiment I offered a drop of my own blood, which one of them drank greedily. The others Drinkers are beginning to wither.",
        "I collected a bucket of human blood from the healers. I had to pay her an exhorbitant amount to keep her tongue still. The Drinkers are doing much better. Am I doing the right thing? The benefit of these plants to all of Cyrodiil is beyond doubt, but the price may be too high.",
        "It is one of the most difficult decisions of my life. I have destroyed my notes for how to hybridize Drinkers. I set the trays on the roof where the sun could strike them. An hour after sunrise they were all dead. My attempt to create a hybrid of vampire and plant has failed. They were just too dangerous.",
        "Two parts grave dust, one part ash salts. Mix with human blood. Expose to two hours of moonlight each night."
