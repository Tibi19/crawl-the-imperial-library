I've informed everyone within the keep, including the guard, that all repairs and requests for new weapons should be sent your way. Jarl Laila has been notified of this as well, and she extends her sincerest thanks for your contributions to the defense of the city. Just remember, I've stuck my neck out for you by using my name, so don't make me look the fool by letting your standards slide.",
