        "Courage to you and full-hearted greetings. The preparations are laid for glorious victory. The coast south of Velyn Harbor is nigh unoccupied, fertile ground to set the roots of our raiding parties. It should be no difficulty to conceal our ships among the rocks, or inland among the trees, and take them to the sea for plunder.",
