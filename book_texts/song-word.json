        "(A Traditional Song)",
        "The words you hear are based on meat - don't let the sophists fool you\nFear not upon the walking way - just let hysteria rule you\nIn their own world, the mad have laws - but only if they're written\nThe wise can write them different rules - for by the word they're smitten",
        "Use no words for apologies - if you seek absolution\nAction is the walking way - and words are no solution\nThe wise avoid apology - when ravers must be beaten\nSo sing not with the dusty tongue - no word is true till eaten"
