        "That day we met outside the tourney grounds was \u2026 well, it was a turning point for me. I was so full of anxious energy, like when you're at the beach with too much sun and saltwater taffy. Until you came along, all quiet and confident. You made such an impact on my mood. Helped me to focus.",

        "There are moments in our lives, like that, where everything comes into focus. Where all the things we are are align just so. I've only had one other moment like that in my life.",

I walked deeper into the cave, stepped through some old boards, and fell. It wasn't a bad fall, but my ankle twisted badly when I hit the ground.",

Nothing like what you've seen me call forth in battle time and time again. But enough to see. To get my bearings. To wipe my eyes, grab some old wood to use as a cane, and find my way out.",

        "That day changed my life. And I never stopped praying.",

        "I'm not saying you're like Stendarr. That's not \u2026 ugh. I'm saying you changed my life too. In a wonderful, delightful way. Also, I haven't told that story to almost anyone. Not even Aurelia. So \u2026 don't go spreading it around.",
