        "The moment you have been waiting for has finally arrived. I have an opportunity for you. A unique opportunity, to show the Court and our benefactor just how cunning you can be. You know how he appreciates a savvy deal maker.",
        "I am entrusting you with several tomes I acquired at a hefty price. They describe a place between realms, a gap, or rather a pit of emptiness that lies between our world and Oblivion.
