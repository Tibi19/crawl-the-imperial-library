        "When Peladius taught me how to write, I didn't think I'd take to it the way I have. Maybe if the gods had given me a pen instead of a sword, I would've spent my life writing books instead of sacking caravans. Well, too late to whine about it now.",

        "As for the name, it came from a conversation I had with Pale-Eyes one night at The Grey Mare in Chorrol. I asked him why Argonian names were so literal, and his reply was, \"Why aren't yours?\"",

        "I laughed, realizing I was bested. So I asked him to give me an Argonian name, one that suited someone of my ilk.",

        "",
        "The funny thing about an Argonian name is, I wasn't sure if it was meant to define the person I was or the one I aspired to be. I suppose the point is moot now. I'll probably die in this tower without a septim to my name. But at least if I keep writing, people will know our story, and know that we once lived.",
