        "3rd Frostfall\nI've been tricked and led astray! There's no hoard here, no heaps of gold. Just cogs and springs and hissing pipes. What a fool I've been! I can't despair, though. There has to be something of value in this place.",
        "Something hidden. I'll find it. I've worked too hard to turn back now.",
        "4th Frostfall\nI've found a book. No small feat given how many of those damned mechanical spiders are skittering about. The writing is so small and smudged, but it looks like plans for building something. Something big. Whatever it is, I'm usre it's in here somewhere. It just has to be!",
        "6th Frostfall\nStendarr's mercy, there are so many of them. Those huge walking machines. Lucky for me, they clank and thud louder than wagon-wheels on cobblestone.",
        "They know I'm here. Their patrols are becoming more frequent. They've got to be protecting something. What a stroke of luck! No one protects something unless it has value. I may make my fortune yet!",
        "8th Frostfall\nIt's found me. By the Eight, it's huge! It hears everything. Even quill strokes on paper! I'm never going to make it out of here alive. Mara help me!",
        "If you're reading this, don't go any farther. Let it sleep. Don't wake it up."
