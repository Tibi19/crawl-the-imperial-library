        "Entry 1\nWhile patrolling the Radius with Adjunct Daro, we happened upon a strange sight - someone managed to open a portal into the Clockwork City! Since I had my perception tabulator and Daro at my side, I decided to step closer and investigate.",
        "Entry 2\nI decided to take notes, as the perception tabulator can sometimes be temperamental. Without thinking about it, I found myself directly in front of the portal. It has an unusual attraction.",
        "Entry 3\nI stepped through the portal, though I can't actually remember doing so. The place is eerily beautiful, like a land of perpetual twilight. That s'wit Daro didn't come with me! No matter. I think I'll look around."
