        "Operational Notes:",
        "Originally identified as a possible mole due to his background, Ehlhiel was fed the information regarding his parents and recruited as an asset. In the years following, he proved to be a valuable source of information in identifying bandit groups, as well as helping the Imperial City guard expunge the Crimson Dirks from Cyrodiil.",
        "",
        "Currently, Ehlhiel continues to serve both the East Empire Company and the guard captains in Skyrim by providing information on fugitives that fled north after the purge. Meetings can be set up by placing a note behind the Shrine of Akatosh in Solitude. Any additional contact should be arranged through the appropriate channels."
