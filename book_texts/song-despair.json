        "The memory of answers torn from fate\nThe destruction of all who cannot wait.\nAt dusk and dawn, the Rose Queen rules\nWhile thieves of night still own the dark.\nGreen dragon's breath pollutes cloud and pool\nAs silent spider spins webs that mark.\nThe broken oath and the traitor's plot,\nThe huntsman's horn and sharpened spear\nMake wishes pacts that come to naught\nWhen madness claims those who would appear.\nLife stands death upon its head\nAs sweet lust joins in pools of blood.\nEscape the curse with no tears to shed\nAs nightmares arrive all in a flood.\nDisease and plague are no end of life\nWhen mastered by the harvester of strife."
