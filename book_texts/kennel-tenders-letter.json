        "I have found work in Wrothgar, not terribly interesting but it pays well enough. My employer is a beatmaster they call Eofryd Durzog-Whistler. She's a little eccentric. She has a natural talent for taming beasts, it's obvious, and I think she likes them better than she likes humans. As far as I can tell we're here not so much because of the durzogs, but to protect her from other people.",
        "It is wonderful to see her work, though. She has such an amazing rapport with the animals. I could watch her all day.",
        "Any way I will send you gold as soon as I get paid.",
        "Your devoted son, Philip"
