        "Let us fly together, dear red bird,\nset aside the idle talk of stern elders,\nas you set aside the ground below!\nGrains of sand trickle through the glass:\nbut when together we fly,\nnight is one long everlasting journey.\nAlight upon my shoulder, my neck, my cheek,\nlet your sweet beak leave a hundred,\nnay a thousand kisses upon me.\nLet us confuse them,\nso that no enemy may cast an evil eye,\nwhen it comes to be known the many kisses."
