        "I think Kireth and I may have discovered what we need to finally prove ourselves to the Arch-Mage at the Academy of Shad Astula. The Dwemer ruins of northern Tamriel hold amazing treasures of the lost Dwarves, but these places are often too dangerous to navigate. I have discovered several references in old texts to a method for controlling Dwemer constructs through the use of a harmonic device that interacts with the constructs' resonators. It'll take some time, and no small effort, but I think I can actually build a prototype of the device to test.",
