        "This shall be my masterwork, an accounting of everything I know about the ores, metals, and alloys of Tamriel.\nFirst: Iron, in all its many and wondrous varieties.",
        "We begin with Bog Iron which, true to its name, is \"mined\" by digging in ferrous peat, within which pea-sized nodules of ore can be found by the assiduous bog-iron seeker. Bog iron is prized because iron forged from its ore is often highly resistant to rusting, which naturally makes it perfect for a variety of applications.",
        "Then there is Cold Iron, which can be found throughout the frozen mountains of Skyrim. Even after it is worked and forged, this unique metal retains a chill that keeps it cold to the touch\u2014regardless of the temperature around it. Cold Iron has a number of uses, and holds enchantments very well.",
        "In my travels I have also come across a mysterious metal. I'm not sure if it's iron, as my encounter with this strange ore was rather brief and interrupted by the sudden appearance of trolls \u2026."
