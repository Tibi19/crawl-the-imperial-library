        "The Heritance Rhyme:\nWhispers and squabbles,\nLook how the crown wobbles,\nThe blind queen tumbles and spins,\nWith cat's claws she scratches,\nBrave traitors she catches,\nThen hangs them all with a grin!",
        "Boats and Bones:\nTen and fifty lean years, a pocket full of stones,\nCaves and vineyards tainted, packed full of bones,\nCaptains raise your banners and launch a thousand boats,\nSink the slugfolk's islands, stab any Sload that floats!",
        "Song of Claws and Roots:\nGather sap and sharp teeth,\nWhiskers, claws, and moon wreaths,\nTopal brutes and Elden Roots, with knives and sabers unsheathed,\nCut their leashes quickly, watch them foam and roar,\nFeed them drakes and lions, that's all that they're good for!"
