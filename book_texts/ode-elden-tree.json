        "Saplings sprout from spring soil,\nShapers shape them with great toil,\nBut none dared touch the bark of thee,\nThe Acorn destined for Elden Tree.\nWise the owl sitting on your limb,\nSilent the snake winding long and slim,\nAround your trunk the fates do dance,\nBoth fey and mild take revered stance.\nYou shelter us e'er from the storm,\nYou defend us from the angry swarm,\nWar can't tear your mighty root,\nStrength is in your every fruit.\nSaplings still sprout 'round your base,\nThe shapers work at mighty pace,\nAll revere your o'er-arching boughs,\nIn Elden Tree, our worries drowse."
