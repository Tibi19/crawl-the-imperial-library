        "A Traditional Myth",
        "When the Lady Genevrah was kidnapped from her estate and held for  ransom, her mother sent word out that whoever rescued her would be  allowed to marry her and inherit the land. Unfortunately, in those  troubled days, kidnappings, murders, and thievery were rampant, and  there was a dearth of able-bodied adventurers for such assignments. In  fact, the only person who answered her call was a skinny, little fellow  named Baranat.",
        "\u201cYou are certainly brave, but I fear you would never survive,\u201d said the  old woman. \u201cMy daughter, you see, has been kidnapped by the Coribael  brothers whose physical prowess is the stuff of legend.\u201d",
        "\u201cMy lady,\u201d said Baranat. \u201cWhen I was born, I was blessed by Vivec,  Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, and I have the ear of the saints. If I run  into any trouble, I'll call on them to aid my quest.\u201d",
        "Doubtful, but having no other prospects, the old woman sent Baranat off,  explaining that the four brothers' camp was to the north. In the center  of the camp, the eldest and most powerful brother Airen Coribael was  holding Lady Genevrah personally. Each of his brothers guarded a  different post along the valley -- Baranat would have to defeat each to  rescue the lady.",
        "Baranat rode many miles through the northern swamps before he came to  the first of the brothers' guard posts. There he saw Vanis Coribael, the  youngest of the brothers, watching the valley for intruders. Vanis was  known to be faster than the wind, a warrior who could thrash his  opponents before they even unsheathed their weapons. Baranat look a look  at his sad, cut-rate iron blade, and prayed to the saints.",
        "Saint Veloth the Pilgrim appeared before Baranat in shining robes, and  smiled upon him, \u201cBaranat, put down your blade and I will make you  swifter than bolt of lightning.\u201d",
        "Baranat dropped his blade and ran at Vanis, moving so fast he didn't  rustle a leaf with his pace. In a flash, Vanis was dead by Baranat's  hands. The adventurer continued on until he reached the second youngest  Coribael brother, Feryn, who not only was as fast as Vanis, but so  strong, he could rip a trama shrub up by the roots with two fingers.  Baranat hid himself and trembled as he looked at the giant Feryn  Coribael. Again, the young adventurer prayed to the saints.",
        "Saint Nerevar the Captain appeared before Baranat in golden armor, and  smiled upon him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you stronger than a hundred  warriors.\u201d",
        "Baranat rushed at Feryn, knocking the giant through a boulder which  turned to dust on impact. Feryn tried to get to his feet, but Baranat  tore him apart, scattering him across the valley floor in eighty-seven  pieces. Beyond Feryn's post was a raging river, where the second eldest  Coribael brother, Horis, stood guard. Horis, who was faster than his  brother Vanis, stronger than his brother Feryn, and so tough that he  could swim in the lava of Dagoth Ur like it was the Padomaic Ocean.  Baranat thought of his own tolerance for pain, which was minimal, and  prayed to the saints for help.",
        "Saint Roris the Martyr appeared before Baranat with flesh like sparkling  gems, and smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you unyielding as the  heart of Oblivion.\u201d",
        "Baranat rushed at Horis, and two plunged into the rushing river. For  twelve hours, they wrestled one another under the water, until Horis  could hold his breath no more and drowned. Baranat pulled himself out of  the river and continued down the valley, until he reached the camp.  Airen Coribael himself was there, guarding a squirming sack which  Baranat assumed either contained Lady Genevrah or several large cats.  The young adventurer quailed at the prospect of doing battle with Airen  Coribael, the swiftest, strongest, sturdiest, and most accomplished  fighter of the brothers. He prayed to the saints for help.",
        "Saint Olms the Just appeared before Baranat in a burst of flame, and  smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you more cunning in battle than the  most dangerous of daedra.\u201d",
        "Baranat walked calmly into the camp and began battle with Airen  Coribael. The fight lasted seven days, and for six of them, Airen had  the upper hand. He rained kicks and punches down using the arrhythmic  style the Khajiit call Goutfang; he parried and blocked in all the  fashions of the great Nordic warriors; he maintained his balance,  coordination, speed, strength, timing, and tactics as the moons rose and  fell from the sky. But on the seventh day, as he was preparing his  Killing Blow, he suddenly stopped, eyes wide open. The blood drained  from his face, and he realized the trap he had stepped into. A trap with  no escape. With three quick flashes of his hand, Baranat completed the  Cycle of Blood, the old Redguard fighting style he had begun on day one.  Airen Coribael breathed no more.",
        "The young adventurer ran to open the sack where Lady Genevrah lay. His  first surprise. She had a face like a dreugh and as she began to berate  him for taking his time, he realized that she had a very, very, very  unpleasant personality as well. Several days later, when they were back  at the old woman's court, he discovered that the estate that he would be  inheriting was utterly dissolute by decades of blight storms and poor  crops.",
        "Saint Delyn the Wise watched the young adventurer from a cloud in the  sky, and smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, before you fight, find out what you're  fighting for.\u201d"
