        "I finished investigating the Howling Sepulchers in the eastern part of Upper Craglorn\u2014at least, as much as I could manage. The place is crawling with all kinds of dead things! Well, they're moving around and are pretty angry, so it's not like they're really dead. But they are dead and \u2026 oh, bother, I'm not making any sense, am I?",
        "Dead warriors and shamans and wolves, prowling the Sepulchers and attacking anything that's actually alive that gets too close. Dangerous place! And I didn't see any of the red brittle, but that's mostly because I turned around and started running the moment I entered the place and saw all the angry dead people.",
