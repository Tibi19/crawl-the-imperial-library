        "Even now, my agents lay in wait. They have been instructed to ambush the Marines and outfit themselves with their uniforms and weapons. Disguised thus, they will burn Silsailen to the ground. When word of the atrocity spreads, the blame will be laid upon Ayrenn herself. As we agreed, you will be named Canonreeve of Skywatch in return for your loyalty and assistance.",
