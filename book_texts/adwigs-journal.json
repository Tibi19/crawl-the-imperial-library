Better to find a quiet place and lay low for a while, I think. Just need to keep an eye on the sea. The company's got to send someone to look for us eventually.\\n\\n?. Midyear, 2E 575",

We bicker from time to time\u2014mostly about what to eat, and how they never do the washing up, or whose sweethearts were finer back before the wreck. Even so, I can't imagine surviving in this wilderness without them. Better to suffer with company than to suffer alone!",

Don't know if the Mornards tightened up patrols or people just stopped traveling here. Doesn't really matter, I suppose. I've got my lads to keep me company, and I've got nowhere else I need to be."
