        "But the curse was broken long ago. The truth is, it wasn't Nocturnal that robbed me of my life. It was my selfishness.",

        "I wore the cowl out of pure greed. I left my family because I loved only myself.",

        "",
        "With the boy in danger, it's time I took responsibility as the head of this clan. But if I'm to be his father, I have to stop being a stranger. I must pass the cowl onto another, and in doing so, the Gray Fox must die.",

        "Until then, I come to this grave every night bringing flowers, to ask my sister for forgiveness."
