        "(A traditional tavern song)",
        "Well, Clavicus mortals call me\nYes, Wish-Bone is my name\nFor mortals' jests are not the best\nTheir wits are halt and lame",
        "On top of that they call me Vile\nBecause I tell the truth\nI only show them their true selves\nIn candor without ruth",
        "I give the mortals what they ask\nThough never what they want\nI but fulfill the terms they name\nThen mock, and gibe, and taunt",
        "It's Clavicus Vile they all summon\nCat, Human, Orc, and Elf\nBut they'll never know my secret name\nThat I sing to just Myself",
        "Hide your true name in secret\nProtected by wall and tower\nFor those who learn your hidden name\nWill have you in their power",
        "But you will ne'er outwit me\nAnd make me do as you bid\nFor you're just a foolish mortal\nAnd my secrets are well hid!"
