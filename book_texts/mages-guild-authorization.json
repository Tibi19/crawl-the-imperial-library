        "The Mages Guild hereby grants Warlock Kargand authorization to organize an excursion into the tunnels beneath the Elden Tree, the necropolis known as Elden Hollow, to investigate the disappearances of mages",
        "Bakkhara and Dracien Montue. Both went missing following the release of an unknown magical phenomenon that occurred when Canonreeve Oraneth finished an unidentified ritual in the depths of the Hollow.",
        "The Guild was unable to elicit information regarding Oraneth's activities from the Thalmor, as the Canonreeve acted without the knowledge of her government. The Guild therefore decrees a second objective for Warlock Kargand's expedition: discover the Canonreeve's motives and methods in completing her ritual."
