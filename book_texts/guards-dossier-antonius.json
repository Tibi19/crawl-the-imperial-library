        "Background:",
        "Antonius is a former battlemage said to possess a highly analytical mind that is matched only by his more prurient inclinations. He is sought after by aristocrats in Firsthold for allegedly poisoning a court wizard named Allenia with skooma, although it's unclear if he did so maliciously or simply introduced her to the substance. After fleeing to Cyrodiil he joined the Crimson Dirks and advised them on the acquisition and smuggling of magical artifacts.",
        "",
        "Bottled spirits and old age have made him less urgent of a target, but all members of the bandit clan are still considered high priority and should be captured or eliminated.",
        "",
        "Operational Notes:",
        "Antonius is believed to have a number of vices, most notably an addiction to gambling. Rather than search for him, it would be best to have a guardsman stationed near the pits where like-minded degenerates tend to gather. Cragslane Cavern is said to be thriving with activity as of late, and may be worth a look."
