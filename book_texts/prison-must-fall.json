        "The Daedra have overwhelmed the Prison. They run it now, led by a massive creature made from darkness, and carried on great wings.",
        "But it is about his lieutenant that I write. The \"Flesh Sculptor\" they call him, a powerful necromancer. It is at his behest that citizens are taken here, and harvested. The Sculptor has mastered devilry that allows him to turn mortal organs into carriers for plague and disease\u2014flesh devices that spew noxious clouds to contaminate the earth around them.
