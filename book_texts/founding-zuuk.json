        "Lord Zuuk returned to Shadowfen after the fall of Reman Cyrodiil III, founding a small settlement in the Shadowfen. After five generations of prosperity, our ancestors renamed it Zuuk in honor of our Lord Founder. The original name of the settlement was lost to time.",
        "We know little of Zuuk's time in the Imperial Palace, but his wealth, honor, and generosity were renowned among the Kothringi. May his name be on the lips of his descendants for another five generations."
