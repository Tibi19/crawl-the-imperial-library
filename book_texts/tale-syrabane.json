        "A war was the only way\nTo stop the plague at hand\nSo Syrabane called for aid\nAll throughout the land",
        "CHORUS\nOh, Syrabane, oh Syrabane\nYe mer of godly fate\nOh Syrabane, oh Syrabane\nThe youngest of the Eight",
        "Man and Mer took up the call\nThey knew they could not fail\nTogether they combined their might\nThe All Flags Navy sailed",
        "With Bendu Olo at his side\nSlinging sword and spell\nSyrabane beat back the tide\nThe Coral Kingdom fell",
        "CHORUS",
        "Now good mer, remember well\nThe Archmage Syrabane\nFor when dark times came to pass\nHe knew to ask for aid",
        "CHORUS"
