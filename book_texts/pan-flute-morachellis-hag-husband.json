        "This pan flute belonged to the legendary skald and former instructor, Morachellis Hag-Husband. He was one of the few masters of this obscure instrument. Noted for his eccentricities, it is said Morachellis crafted the flute from the leg bone of his twin brother, who died in a mishap. Ever mischievous the skald would sometimes confirm this story and sometimes deny it.",
        "Given the unsettling material of the flute and the questionable hygiene of playing it, Morachellis had few students to tutor and no successor."
