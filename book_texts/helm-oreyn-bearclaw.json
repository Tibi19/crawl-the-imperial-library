        "I should have known better than to trust an apprentice to locate the Bloodworm Helm. I described its features, thinking that would be enough. A trollbone skull with an open maw. A necromancer's crown.",
        "",
        "This skull clearly belongs to a bear. Never mind the enchantments placed upon it are for a warrior. Still, it seems my apprentices have stumbled upon a find nonetheless. The helm is that of Oreyn Bearclaw, the fabled warrior of the Wood Elves.",
        "",
        "Perhaps I will raise a Bosmer, give him the helm, and have him perform the slaying of the witch-serpent Glenhwyfaunva for my amusement.",
        "",
        "As for the artifacts of Mannimarco, I will have to redouble my search efforts. Perhaps this new girl, Naara, will have better luck finding them. She is green, but ambitious."
