        "I demand that you take immediate action against the traitorous \"Captain Helane\" and her band of Sea Drakes!",
        "They have held the island's only lighthouse for over a year now. In that time, 18 ships have run upon the rocks.",
        "I have no doubt that Helane is sabotaging the lighthouse to wreck these ships, leaving her minions to loot the broken holds. While this greatly enriches her, she pays no taxes to you. Is this not a crime?",
        "Trade is your currency, and shipping your life's blood. What do you think will happen as a result of Helane's piracy? Ships will seek harbor elsewhere. Food will stop coming.",
        "Will you eat lizards? Mudcrabs? Rats? What will you do when you run out of wool for clothing or leather for shoes? If trade with your fiefdom ceases to be profitable, your new regime will be short indeed.",
        "I implore you to gather your Bloody Fists and any fools you can buy. Send your army to Saintsport, rout the Sea Drakes, and take Helane's head before she grows even more powerful.",
        "I am your staunchest ally in Glenumbra and will be so as long as our partnership remains profitable. Silence Helane. Let our partnership not wither.",
        "If you leave Helane's greed unchecked, the next head on a pike may be your own.",
        "Your friend,\nLady Brunwyn"
