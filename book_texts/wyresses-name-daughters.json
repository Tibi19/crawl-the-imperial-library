        "In Elden time, Elven time, Jephre did come\nA-naming of creatures where'er he did run\nAs all was chaotic, and names were unknown\nHis gift was a name for each beast, plant, and stone\nThen all knew their places except Men and Mer\nWho plundered and ravaged wherever they were\n\"I name you the Earth-Bones,\" Jephre decreed,\n\"Lords of the forest, rock, root, and seed.\nThis heritage nurture, henceforth be its guards\nAnd designate worthies to act as its wards.\"\nThereafter did Wyrd Women watch o'er the Green,\nFrom tundra to forest, from peak to ravine,\nReminding all creatures, be it tiger or worm\nOf their name and their nature, their function and form.\nWould-be corrupters who'd canker the Green\nShall face wyress warding wherever they're seen.\nSo tread woods with caution, respect Jephre's way\nLest Wyrd women watching abduct you away."
