        "[This volume is an encyclopedic reference to the Lords of the Daedric  Realms, their chief clans, the themes and spheres of influence of each  clan, and to the legends and lore associated with those mortals who  traffick with Daedra.]",
        "Azura, whose sphere is dusk and dawn, the magic inbetween realms of  twilight\nBeothiah, whose sphere is deceit and conspiracy, and the secret plots of  murder, assassination, treason, and unlawful overthrow of authority\nClavicus Vile, whose sphere is the granting of power and wishes through  ritual invocations and pact\nHermaeus Mora, whose sphere is scrying of the tides of Fate, of the past  and future as read in the stars and heavens, and in whose dominion are  the treasures of knowledge and memory\nHircine, whose sphere is the Hunt, the Sport of Daedras, the Greatest  Game, the Chase and Sacrifice of Mortals\nMalacath, whose sphere is the patronage of the spurned and ostracized,  and the Sworn Oath, and the Bloody Curse\nMehrunes Dagon, whose sphere is Destruction, Change, Revolution, Energy,  and Ambition\nMephala, whose sphere is obscured to mortals; known by the names  Webspinner, Spinner, and Spider; whose only consistent theme seems to be  interference in the affairs of mortals for her amusement\nMeridia, whose sphere is obscured to mortals; who is associated with the  energies of living things\nMolag Bal, whose sphere is the domination and enslavement of mortals;  whose desire is to harvest the souls of mortals and to bring mortals  souls within his sway by spreading seeds of strife and discord in the  mortal realms \nNamira, whose sphere is the ancient Darkness; known as the Spirit  Daedra, ruler of sundry dark and shadowy spirits; associated with  spiders, insects, slugs, and other repulsive creatures which inspire  mortals with an instinctive revulsion \nNocturnal, whose sphere is the night and darkness; who is known as the  Night Mistress\nPeryite, whose sphere is the ordering of the lowest orders of the  Oblivion; who is known as the Taskmaster\nSanguine, whose sphere is hedonistic revelry and debaucherie, and  passionate indulgences of darker natures\nSheogorath, whose sphere is Madness, and whose motives are unknowable\nVaernima, whose sphere is the realm of dreams and nightmares, and from  whose realm isues forth evil omens",
        "[especially marked for special interest under the heading \"Malacath\" you  find a reference to SCOURGE, blessed by Malacath, and dedicated to the  use of mortals. In short, the reference suggests that any daedra  attempting to invoke the weapon's powers will be expelled into the  voidstreams of Oblivion.]",
        "\"Of the legendary artifacts of the daedra, many are well known, like  Azura's Star, and Sheogorath's Wabbajack. Others are less well known,  like Scourge, Mackkan's Hammer, Bane of Daedra....",
        "\"...yet though Malacath blessed Scourge to be potent against his daedra  kin, he thought not that it should fall into daedric hands, then to  serve as a tool for private war among caitiff and forsaken. Thus did  Malacath curse the device such that, should any darkkin seek to invoke  its powers, that a voidhole should open and swallow that daedra, and  purge him into Oblivion's voidstreams, from thence to pathfind back to  the Real and Unreal Worlds in the full order of time.\""
