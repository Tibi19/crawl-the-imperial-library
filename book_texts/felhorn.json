        "Felhorn claimed the Brimstone Crown in the bloody revolt known as the Gladiator Uprising. He led an army into the Arena and demanded to fight the current Champion, Ferian Darkstorm. Ferian reluctantly agreed, and after a monumental fight, the former Champion was cleaved in two by Felhorn's enchanted sword. Humbled by his near defeat, Felhorn disbanded his army and took his seat as Champion of the Blessed Crucible. It was he who erected great monuments to Malacath within the arena.",
