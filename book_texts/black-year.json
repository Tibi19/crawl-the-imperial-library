        "We know not when Ukaezai first tired of her duty and began eliciting her entertainment from unsuspecting Mer. Perhaps it was a passing fancy before its culmination. If it was, this went undetected by her masters.",
        "In monsoon season, when the Strid was full and even the Graht Oaks fought to keep the soil beneath them, the master of archives and half his assistants opened the mighty doors to the reliquary.",
