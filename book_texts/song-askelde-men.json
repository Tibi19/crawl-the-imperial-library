        "Fifty Nights from home I last awoke\nupon a sky-flung cliff in Hjaalmarch Hold",
        "Though my flesh had died and gone to ground\nMy Vision went on, from body unbound",
        "Winking there in the vale whence I came\nThis dead man's eyes saw pale flame",
        "Where men the same who took life away\nSung high their battle-glory and praise",
        "Wafting went I, a shade or a wight\nThrough stoic pines, pitched ink of night",
        "Ere I came upon the pyre-burning throng\nI heard carried on wind's wing their song",
        "\"Sing high and clear, bandsmen born of sky\nLet Sovngarde hear and join our cry\"",
        "\"These honored dead shed blood upon the fen\nEnding Orc and Elf and traitor men.\"",
        "\"Your spirit went unto and filled their heart\nYou sped them to glory, Hail Spirit Wulfharth\"",
        "Then oil from urns fed greedy flames\nburning what few my legion and I slayed",
        "Wordlessy they chanted then until dawn\nEvery flake of ash gathered ere they marched on",
        "Swept along unseen, so too went I\nMeekly haunting these Children of the Sky",
        "Tireless they went, over hearth and hill\nExhaustion seemed only to spur them still",
        "Unflagging they went, a whorl of rage\nSoon finding our camp, bloated with prey",
        "My dead heart ached for I knew men within\nDoomed, never knowing how close was their end",
        "Again the Nord chests swelled up in refrain\nI screamed unheard. I wept with horror plain",
        "\"Hear us, our ancestor, Ash King, Ysmir\nHonor this warband as we to glory repair\"",
        "\"Those dead to whom you spoke and heard\nWe bear them upon us, Your valor conferred\"",
        "And so it was, to the man each was smeared\nWith ash of a Brother's bone, blood and beard",
        "These ashen brutes, the Askelde Men\nSet to a gruesome task, each bowstring bent",
        "I bellowed then, a cry of desperate rage\nA futile howl among those men, an empty page",
        "Yet one elder turned and unblinking, stared\ninto the vapor-soul of me, his nostrils flared",
        "He bellowed ancient words, his beard aflame\nAnd my vision fell away, Peace at last came"
