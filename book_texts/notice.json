        "One of our soldiers came to me last week with an arrow lodged in his leg that he claims came from inside the fort while he was patrolling the walls. When the targets are on the ground, there is no reason an arrow should be loosed that high. Marksmanship is about accuracy, not power and we don't need to be taking out our own soldier.",
        "If I see arrows flying anywhere near that high the one responsible will be on latrine duty for a month.",
