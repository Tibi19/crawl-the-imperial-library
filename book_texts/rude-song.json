        "In the spring of the year\nDoth propriety disappear\nIn the courts and the ports\nOf the Bay.\nDrinking new beer,\nEverybody feels queer\nAnd the Earls and the churls\nGo astray.\nThe bee and the bird\nDon't have to tell us a word.\nOur bodies for naughties\nAre prime.\nIf you haven't heard,\nYou can let yourself be lured\nFor the youth, for things uncouth,\nIt is time.",
        "Oh, it's lovely to sit in a field, harvested into rows\nIt's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.",
        "People of the Bay bless\nThe flowered court of Wayrest\nFor showing us the gentle way of sin\nThe bonny Dark Elf queen\nLikes to see and to be seen\nWith cobblers, thieves,\nAnd tavernkeeps,\nAnd slaves, and fish-er-men.\nIn the court of Lainlyn,\nRight upon the mainland\nWith sex, the whole place is in a whirl.\nThe Baroness likes to play\nWith men who come her way,\nWhile the Baron likes the little boys and girls.",
        "Oh, it's lovely to give your lady a kiss upon her nose\nIt's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.",
        "In Daggerfall, they hold a ball\nAnd all of society indulges in a variety\nOf scandal, they can handle --\nA lot.\nThe Captain of the Guard\nHas to search very hard\nFor a bean that the Queen Has in her pants.\nAnd the Court Sorceress\nWill grant you a wish\nTo cause the King to fling\nAbout his lance.",
        "Oh, it's lovely to give your love a single perfect rose\nIt's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.\nOh, it's lovely to abandon all your cares and fears and woes\nIt's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.\nYes sir, it's lovely not wear any clothes!"
