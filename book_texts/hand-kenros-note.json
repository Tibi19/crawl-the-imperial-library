        "I have found the forge, and when its spark is lit, her fire will burn. The Spectre once worked the gears of this swollen machine, but I no longer require his service. The mechanism is simple. With this vial of Pyroil Tar, I have all that is required to ignite it.",
        "",
        "Tar lit the flame once before, and tar will do so again. And when I return triumphant, fire in hand, she will embrace me once more.",
        "",
        "But I have a problem. The machine requires four gems to power it, and I have procured only one. The others, it seems, are still out there. Yet I have no doubt that as Her chosen, she will guide me to them.",
        "",
        "For now, I will return to the temple. The entrance sits above the mine in Raven Rock, perched atop cliffs of basalt. But even if one finds the cave, only the devout know the way inside the temple. I spin the words and the way opens."
