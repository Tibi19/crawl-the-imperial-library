        "The belief that someone could fully resurrect a dead creature should be disregarded as pointless. Especially when considering what we know about the souls of vampires, such an endeavor may be even considered dangerous. Attempting to thwart the desires of Molag Bal could bring his wrath down upon you, my lady, which would be ruinous for our clan. I hear word of plans for such a project and I firmly warn you to avoid collaboration.",

This reanimates the flesh so that they may execute basic martial functions, such as wielding a sword. If bound correctly, they will follow our commands to the letter. These shall be the perfect heavy shock troops for your new legion.",
