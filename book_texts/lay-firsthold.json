        "Their tribulations drove the Elves\n'Cross Sloadful seas to Summerset.\nO Admeris! Old Ehlnofey!\nYour loving visage haunts us yet.\nYour zephyr's kiss enthralls us still,\nThough only in heart's memory,\nAnd sorrow to the marrow deep\nInfuses every Aldmeri.\nWhen Magnus sinks and night-hour comes,\nAnd owl and spectre prowl and creep,\nWhen eyes can gaze at stars no more,\nThen fancy flits across the deep,\nWhence Aldmer came to eastern isles,\nEscaping doom oblivious,\nTo Auridon, hue-imbued\nWith spectrum vivid, various.\nFrom foam it rose before the ships;\nNine prows did plow the gleaming strand.\nTorinaan stepped from foremost craft,\nAnd claimed as Kinhold all the land\nFrom silver beach to green-clad hills,\nBegilded by the golden dawn.\nAuridon thus was the name\nBestowed upon that realm anon.\nThough wild it was, at once it gripped\nTorinaan's once remorseful heart.\nHe drew his blade, he drew his blood,\nAnd swore an oath to ne'er depart.\nThey disembarked upon the shore,\nBuilt Kinhouse, gardens, forge, and hive.\nThey tamed the meadows, beaches, fields,\nAnd made a home where Elves could thrive.\nThen howling from the hills in hate\nCame horrors horned, bedight with eyes.\nGheatus; Welwa; Ilyadi\u2014\nAll sought the Aldmers' cruel demise.\nSome said they should take ship anew\nAnd seek a farther, safer shore.\nBut bold Torinaan valor steeled,\nAnd drawing on ancestral lore,\nHierogram with Varla Stones\nHe wove upon Auridon's loom,\nDrew power down from stars above,\nAnd drove fell monsters to their doom.\nHe harried them 'cross hills and heights,\nAll smiting them with magics dire,\nTill one by one they fell at last\nTo blast of lightning, ice, or fire.\nSo warded then by spells well-spun\nAuridon bloomed beneath the touch\nOf Altmer craft and husbandry,\nImagoform and sculpture. Much\nAdmired by other Altmer were\nTorinaan's brave achievement there,\nAnd other Kinholds followed fast\nOn Summerset, so blest, so fair.\nBut though those Kinholds prospered well\nThroughout the archipelago,\nAldmeri Landfall all recall\nUpon the Firsthold shore did show,\nAnd bold Torinaan is revered\nFor courage, wisdom, foresight. He\nWho harnessed heaven to defend\nThe Aldmer in extremity.\nAuridon: excellent abode.\nMaormer repel: expel all Sload."
