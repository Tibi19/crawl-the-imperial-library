        "My dearest friend,",
        "I was thrilled to hear that you were traveling to Vvardenfell. A new adventure suits you, and I know you were getting bored back home.",
        "I don't know what you expect to find, but let me tell you what I know of the land of the Dark Elves. The main city in the region is Vivec City. I don't know how you feel about gods and such, but one of the Tribunal\u2014the Living Gods of the Dark Elves\u2014lives in the city. Lord Vivec himself apparently lives in a grand palace there.",
        "You'll probably come ashore in the village of Seyda Neen, if my travel experience was typical. Nice enough location, though the number of smugglers and slavers you run into can be somewhat off-putting.",
        "And wait until you see the Telvanni towers! They grow them out of giant mushrooms, of all things!",
        "Anyway, enjoy your time among the Dark Elves. Hopefully, I'll see you again when you return to Tamriel proper!",
        "Good travels!"
