        "<header>The Underking</header>",
        "<quote>The UnderKing is a mysterious figure, walking through myth and legend. Some say he is actually a very old and powerful Lich, others that he is an Archmage whose very being has been somehow transformed by his use of magic. It is agreed however that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of Tamriel, sending his undead soldiers on errands whose goals only he knows is privy to. It seems his forces often find themselves opposed to The Necromancers, a fact that reassures many, for if they were to unite all of Tamriel would suffer.</quote>",

        "All members and servants of the Necromancers are branded with a black pentagram. The [opponent] barring your path displays one with pride.",

They are vicious foes to those who would follow the roads of Law, often patrolling outer paths and byways for unwary travelers. It is said that the Brotherhood does not associate with any other group, contesting that even the Necromancers are not true to word of the Dark God.
