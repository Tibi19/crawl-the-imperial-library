        "All day long in a dark, dark mine,\nSwing your pick time after time.\nThe sound of metal hitting stone,\nWe work hard, we work alone.\nAll day long toiling in the dark,\nHoping the next vein will hit the mark.\nA poor man dreams of golden ore,\nOur foreman screams, \"Dig some more!\"\nI keep digging and praying to the Eight,\nThat dying beneath a mountain isn't my fate.\nI'm a miner, for better or for worse,\nAnd blood, sweat, and tears won't fill my purse."
