        "* Scout patrol led by Corporal Soft-Wind and scouts Rivis and Aldi sent to investigate second level of sewers, find source of legionnaire infection.",
        "* Lots of trash all around. These Imperials sure are slobs.",
        "* Encountered small packs of legionnaires, all infected. Evaded these foes.",
        "* Tunnel full of scamps. I hate scamps, we went around.",
        "* Lots of small camps of legionnaires. These scum are here to stay.",
        "* Took a quick look at the end of the huge chamber, to see if that lightning Daedra was still down there. Still there, so we snuck away quietly.",
        "* Took the central passage and ran into a Dremora patrol. Just barely survived.",
        "* Says a lot that the infected legion are the least disgusting things down here. I hate these sewers.",
        "* More scamps and clannfear. I hate them too.",
        "* Finally reached the door down to the catacombs. Not looking forward to this.",
        "* Daedra and trash everywhere we look down here. Hard to tell the two apart.",
        "* Snuck past some Dremora guarding a portal. Don't want to know where that goes.",
        "* Atronachs and Daedroth down here. Hope they never come up to the upper levels.",
        "* Saw a citizen being tormented by legionnaires. We rushed to help him but more of them came at the noise. Rivis and Aldi mortally wounded, staggered off to die. I hid and finished this report. No idea how I'll get it back to Belrud."
