        "These chambers known as Fearfangs Cavern are perfect in every way. Not only are they full of Nedic artifacts to study and catalog, but the massive rooms make excellent locations for the Scaled Court to work and rest in almost absolute seclusion. Add to that the nesting grounds we discovered deeper within the complex, and I am extremely pleased with this amazing find.",
        "I have already set the Scaled Court members under my dominion to the task of cataloging the contents of every room and chamber within Fearfangs Cavern. As instructed, we are in search of any information regarding the use and preparation of the primal element we call nirncrux, an element we believe the Nedes were not only intimately familiar with, but which they had unlocked its remarkable potential.",
        "Now I need to get back to the nesting grounds at the far end of the complex. I have work to do with the matron and her brood. Work that will finally provide the soldier the Serpent has been demanding we produce since this grand affair began.",
