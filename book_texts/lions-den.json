        "The valley known as \"The Lion's Den\" was so named because it historically served as a breeding ground for mountain lions. The Nedic peoples of the late Merethic era hunted this population for its furs, but modern inhabitants of the Rift tend to stay clear of the area, finding it easier and safer to harvest the skins and furs of domesticated livestock.",
        "The local populace undoubtedly began to avoid the Lion's Den early in the Second Era, when a small tribe of giants took up residence in the nearby mountains. These giants have been characterized by locals as angry hermits, and have been known to attack trespassers on sight. For this reason the entrance to the valley was walled off, preventing anyone from accidentally wandering into the area."
