        "Dearest Yasmine,",
        "I can't tell you how hard it is for me to write this. I can't go on living this lie. What I mean to say is, I know about you and Ademar. I saw you, three months ago, kiss and exchange a look that meant much more than a kiss. That was the moment suspicion and faith gave way to truth and betrayal.",
        "I won't ask you how you could do it. But I won't remain in a marriage that's not worthy of the name.",
        "Still, I've not given up on you or on us. I still hope that we may be reconciled.",
        "If that hope is not in vain, I pray you'll respond to this letter by meeting me at the entrance to the Buried Sands at the very hour when we first met, all those many years ago.",
        "I think you remember. It had rained most of the day, and then the clouds broke and the sun came out, lighting up your golden hair. I took it as a sign and finally worked up the courage to speak to you.",
        "And now we find ourselves in this untenable situation.",
        "I hope my faith in you is not misplaced,\nPhillip"
