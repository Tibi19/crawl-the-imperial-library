        "Here in Wind Keep we are renowned for producing High Rock's finest light armor: so elegant, so tasteful, and yet so sturdy and staunch. Let me tell you just a little bit about how we do it.",
        "(By \"we,\" of course, I mean the town's families of clothiers: the Raiments, the Garments, and the Habiliments. They do all the actual menial work, though under my noble and capable oversight, naturally.)",
        "Light armor is made entirely of cloth, except for certain structural reinforcements crafted from bone, horn, or cartilage. Though the outer layer of a jerkin or breeches may be of ornamental silk or damask, be aware that underneath is a layer or layers of tough and durable fabric such as cambric or burlap. These layers are often quilted or padded in order to aid in absorbing the force of a blow."
