        "It was a chill, moonless Tirdas night,\nWhen on my window did alight,\nA humble torchbug all aglow,\nWho, passing by, thought to say hello.",
        "How do you fare?\" I did ask.\nAs in his light, my face did bask.\n\"Well and better still,\" said he,\n\"Though I had to leave my humble tree.\"",
        "I thought that was sad and so I said,\n\"Where will you now rest your sleepy head?\"\nImagined I, that it was shelter he did seek,\nBut as a bug, he was asking meek.",
        "\"I leave tonight for southern shores,\nWhere I will winter in due course.\"\nThen before I could stammer a reply,\nHe was aloft, flying away into the sky.",
        "So I pondered to myself alone:\nHere I thought he lost his home,\nAnd upon my abode, he looked with envy,\nBut in the end, the jealous one was me."
