        "I am Abnur Tharn, battlemage and former advisor to the Emperor, and I am calling for allies to join me in the Khajiiti homeland and assist the Khajiiti Defense Force to stop a rage of Dragons.",
        "This terrible danger sweeps through Northern Elsweyr, the province the Khajiit refer to as Anequina. I have decided to offer my services to Lord Gharesh-ri, the Speaker of the Mane, to help their homeland in this time of great need. I cannot deal with this threat by myself.",
        "If you have sword or spell and a desire to test yourself against the ultimate enemy, find me in the town of Riverhold, at K'har Zhab Hall.",
        "And, no, this is not a prank. The Dragons have returned.",
