        "How fortuitous that all the ingredients for the cure are right here in Blackreach! I suppose it makes sense \u2014an affliction born from this strange place would have an antidote hiding in its natural flora.",
        "The key was to find a Blackreach morel in its fruiting variety. This renders the cure far more potent. Though, to be sure of its success, I require a test subject.",
        "<title>Rasir's Journal, Page 5</title>",
        "A test subject has presented itself.",
        "There's an afflicted in one of the caves along the main path. But there's no telling how this will go. The infected are incredibly violent. I do this at great risk to my own life.",
        "Therefore, I will hide the majority of the cure before I enter. If I don't survive this test, someone else will have to take on the responsibility.",
        "<title>Rasir's Journal, Page 8</title>",
        "I've prepared the rare mushroom.",
        "The cure is ready, or as ready as it will ever be.",
        "I am headed to the small cavern northeast of the grotto to perform the test.",
        "With luck, this will not be my last journal entry."
