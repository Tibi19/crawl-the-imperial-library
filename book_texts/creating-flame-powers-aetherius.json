        "Destruction Magic at its Best",
        "Students of spellcrafting refer to the base elemental magics of shock, frost, and fire as \"destruction\" spells. They are excellent for personal defense and wonderful at breaking things. However, one of these pillars reaches far above the others\u2014fire.",
        "Fire consumes, turning order into chaos. A body exposed to fire becomes a pile of ash. Shock merely enervates the body of the victim, and frost saps it of the heat and life. Fire destroys.",
        "In this volume, I shall teach you, the advanced student, how to get the most out of fire spells. How to engulf the mightiest of castles. How to reach into the depths of Aetherius and draw upon the power of a thousand suns.",
