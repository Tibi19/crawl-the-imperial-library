        "I don't know what I did to deserve this assignment. I thought war was supposed to be exciting. All we've done since arriving in this frozen wasteland is wander around like commoners touring the arse-end of Skyrim. And that Valcent gives me the shivers. Why does Owen bend over backwards to please him?",
        "We found houses around a hill today. A woodcutter and his family live here. I spotted old Nord ruins punching up through the crown of the hill. The woodcutter was friendly and hospitable. He even offered us a place to stay. Valcent seems excited, but he won't tell us why.",
        "Ophelia talked to me today. She is such a ray of sunshine in this nasty business. I would walk through fire for her.",
        "Turns out those ruins I saw are a barrow, a place where the Nords bury their dead. Valcent definitely appears interested in the place. He's asking the woodcutter all kinds of questions about it. If he's not careful, he's going to make the woodcutter suspicious.",
        "Valcent ordered us to depart, just when I was starting to get comfortable. I think the woodcutter saw something he wasn't supposed to. And now we're going into the barrow to set up a camp. Why in the world does Valcent want us to camp in there?",
        "Oh, well. Follow orders and never ask questions. That's life in the High King's army."
