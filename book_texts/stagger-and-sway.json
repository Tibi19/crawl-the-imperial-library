        "O my sweet love, she waits for me,\nThrough storm and shine, cross land or sea.\nI run to her and together we,\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss\nHer graceful shape I heave on high\nAnd in one hand I hold her nigh\nHer waiting lips are never dry\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss\nCome the morn she goes\nThe taste of her remains\nAnd in my mind, I see us sway\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss"
