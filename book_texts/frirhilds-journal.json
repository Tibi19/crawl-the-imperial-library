Told her it was one of Eislef's.\nRunning low, might try moon sugar if I run out.\nEvery time Eislef sees that Elf he yells at Rae.\nNot her fault. Can't help herself.\nI can't help her either.\nSaw the Dunmer again. Eislef didn't.\nHad to warn him, make him go away.\nNo good can come of this, not the way Eislef feels."
