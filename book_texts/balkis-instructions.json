        "All right, Balki, I'll give you your shot. I need you to search around Steadfast Manor for a piece of a map. Belonged to a friend of a friend who was last seen around there. It's not far from Gonfalon Bay, but I've heard there are some dangerous characters who like to hide out around the crags, so try not to get robbed. When you have the fragment, bring it to me at the Dufort Docks."
