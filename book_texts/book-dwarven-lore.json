        "In game, this book is described as follows: \"This book on\u00a0Dwarven lore reveals that the Dwarves were destroyed long ago by the\u00a0Dark Elves. There is one interesting passage which translates the Dwarven language, which bears a slight resemblance to Elven.\"",
        "J'ffer has this to say about it:\u00a0\"Marobar Sul's\u00a0Ancient Tales of the Dwemer\u00a0is more comprehensive, but hard to come by, alas, and a weighty tome too, at 16 volumes.\"",
        "\"For 54 gold, Favoril's little book is an excellent overview.\"",
