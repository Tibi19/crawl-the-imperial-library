        "Saw a strange light out over the water last night. I've seen the auroras do some strange things, but never anything quite like this.",
        "Corpses washed up on shore. They were dressed strangely, as if they were from far-off lands. I have no idea where they came from. Tillrani said to send them on to Sovngarde with honors, so we did.",
        "Holsgar found someone on the shore. Shivering in the cold \u2026 but not wet, just damp where they were lying in the snow. Would have died without care. He dragged the body back to town and stuck it in one of the spare beds. Hopefully, the poor soul will survive the night."
