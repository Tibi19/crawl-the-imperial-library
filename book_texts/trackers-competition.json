        "The tracker's competition requires an arrow doused with animal musk that is loosed into the woods. The competitors then attempt to track the arrow by watching the movements of animals attracted to the scent.\nUse this bow to loose a noisemaker arrow with a string attached that follows the same path as the first arrow.",
        "The noise will spook the animals and make tracking them unreliable, but the string will lead our competitor to the prize.",
