        "No-Fingers,\nI run the Burroot Kwama Mine west of Elden Root. Perhaps you've heard of it? I've recently had a bit of a problem with thunderbugs burrowing into the mine and upsetting my kwama. I'd heard you were experienced with beast-handling and hoped you might have something I could use to deter them that wouldn't bother the kwama. I know this is a very specfic request, but if you can help me I would compensate you well."
