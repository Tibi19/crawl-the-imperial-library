        "The survey requested by the League of Kwama Miners is nearly complete at the site. Prospects appear to be real good. The conditions are perfect for seeding a new Kwama hive, provided another queen is born before Frostfall.",
        "If we can't get a viable hive going before that time, we may have to abandon the caverns until the thaw to save on costs. Who knows what could move in between the time of our departure and return? It'd be a crying shame to lose this mine, I'll tell you that.",
        "We'll continue with our scheduled work until we receive word to the contrary, so keep me posted about any changes that will affect us.",
