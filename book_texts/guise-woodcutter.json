        "The guise of woodcutter has served me well. The guards at the gate of Ghartok passed me through without a second glance. This camp has proved an excellent vantage point to spy on the movement of troops from the Southern Morrowind gate. General Khamagash should reward me well upon my return.",
        "The ruined houses to the north and northwest offer even better views of the main routes for troop movements, but I risk much for those vistas. Why would a simple woodcutter be crouching among the still-smoldering ruins? Even the dull-witted Pact guards would question such a thing. My luck has held thus far, as no eyes have spied me, no cry has arisen. May Onsi continue to watch over me."
