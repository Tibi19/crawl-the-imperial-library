        "Be a dear and search this crypt if you would. That's a good graverobber! It's rather dark and dreary down there, and I'd rather not get cobwebs in my hair. Besides, I'm paying you well to recover relics, heirlooms, and other such valuables. I'll be at the camp. Bring whatever you find to me.",
        "Oh, and I better not catch you or any of your fellow thugs pocketing any of the treasures you dig up. After I catalog all of our findings, I'll make sure you get your fair share.",
