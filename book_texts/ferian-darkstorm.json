        "Ferian Darkstorm, also known as Ferian the Passive, reigned as Champion for a very short time. It is said that he grew soft and complacent once he was crowned Champion, and was known to fight only when severely criticized. His lack of willingness to defend his crown led to the first Gladiator Uprising, when prominent gladiator named Felhorn led his clan into the Arena to force Ferian's hand. Ferian eventually acceded to the pressure, lest he and all his guards be destroyed by the angry gladiators, but in the end, Ferian still fell under Felhorn's blade.",
