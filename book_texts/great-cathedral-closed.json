        "By order of Artorius Ponticus, Primate of Great Akatosh, let it be known that public access to the Grand Cathedral of Akatosh will be denied while work crews conduct maintenance and renovations to the aging stonework and creaking floorboards of our magnificent house of worship.",
        "This does not, however, mean that worship discontinues within the holy city of Kvatch. Our diligent Chanters and Sermonizers will walk among you, spreading the word and will of Akatosh and the other Divines.",
        "Just as the loyal swords of the Order of the Hour defend our hearths and homes, let the words of the Chanters and Sermonizers shore up your spirits and fill you with the truth of the Dragon God of Time."
