        "This ancient Trinimac House Idol, from late in the First Era, shows that even during the time of the original Orsinium, some Orcs were intent on worshiping Trinimac\u2014even if they only did so in the privacy of their own homes.",
        "Tiny statues such as this one depicted stylized beasts cast from solid gold that were dedicated to Trinimac and placed inside homes to provide protection, comfort, and a focal point for private worship. Bears, pigs, goats, and even horkers have been found from this period, cast in gold and bearing the mark of Trinimac.",
        "The area around Paragon's Remembrance, an ancient site devoted to the veneration of Trinimac, has long been a source of these tiny statues, and is the most likely place to recover any idols that still survive."
