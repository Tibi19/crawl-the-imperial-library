        "O Great Raj-deelith, let me tell you of the wonders of the great and glorious city of the Dark Elves, Mournhold!",
        "I was sent to serve with the Pact troops assigned to the Deshaan region of Morrowind, and at the first opportunity I took leave to explore the fabled city of the Dunmer. Like most of the Saxhleel that grew up in our village, I had heard the horror stories about the Dark Elf city and how terribly they treated our people there. I was almost expecting to see slaves and torture devices on every corner, even though we are now friends and allies, but nothing could be further from the truth.",
        "For the most part, the Dark Elves I encountered were hospitable if not friendly, and there was an abundance of people of other races wandering the markets as well. I met Nords and Wood Elves, Imperials and Bretons, even a Khajiit and High Elf during my visit. And the variety of goods available in the market\u2014it was almost more than I could comprehend!",
        "The Tribunal Temple was a sight to behold! It was huge and daunting, but also sacred, like standing in the shadow of one of the great Hist trees. I even met an Argonian who had adopted the worship of the Three as his own. Talking to him was interesting, but I could never find it in my heart to revere a being of flesh and blood, let alone a Dark Elf!",
        "I also had a chance to visit one of the famed Dark Elf corner clubs. The place was called the Flaming Nix, and it boasted fire pit right in the center of the main hall where intoxicated patrons took turns leaping in to dance among the hot coals. I admit I tried it myself. It was exhilarating! Although I think it would have been better if I had had a few bottles of flin before I stepped into the fire.",
        "I'll write again soon! Say hello to my egg-siblings for me!",
