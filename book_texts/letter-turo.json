        "Dearest Daini,",
        "I made every attempt to turn a blind eye to your mischief here in South Guard. As a final courtesy to your father, I allowed you to remain here, even in your old home, without harassment. But your recent raids on my workers and my property cannot go unpunished.",
        "I have your friends. Most of them will avoid the noose and live as slaves. Yet another show of kindness on my part. Your brother, however, will swing unless you turn yourself over to me immediately. No delays. No negotiations.",
        "I regret that it had to come to this. I await your swift surrender. As does your brother.",
        "Sincerely yours,\nTuro"
