        "I.\nI sing of Ellabeth, the Queen of the Axe,\nWho could fell a full elm with two hatchet hacks.\nShe could rip apart Valenwood just for her fun.\nShe studied under Alfhedil in Tel Aruhn.\nHe taught her the jabs, the strokes, and the stance\nTo make an ax-swing into an elegant dance.",
        "He taught her the barbed axes of the Orcs bold,\nThe six-foot-long axes favored in Winterhold,\nThe hollow-bladed axes of the Elves of the West,\nWhich whistle when they swing through flesh.\nWith a single-headed axe, she could behead two men.\nWith a double-headed axe, she could fell more than ten.\nYet where she lives in legend has most to do\nWith the man who hacked her own heart in two.",
        "II.\nNienolas Ulwarth the Mighty, who hailed from Blackrose,\nThe only man who could best Ellabeth with ax blows,\nIn a minute, she chopped fifty trees; he, fifty-three.\nShe felt at once that he was the only man for she.\nWhen she professed her love, Nienolas just laughed.\nHe said he loved more his ax handle and shaft.\nAnd if they weren't enough to slake all his desire\nThere was another woman named Lorinthyrae.\nFury gripped the Queen of the Axe, the maid Ellabeth,\nAnd her thoughts turned to pondering musings of death.\nMephala and Sheogorath gave her a revengeful scheme\nAnd for weeks, she worked on it in a state like a dream.\nIn the still of the night, she kidnapped her rival\nAnd then told her choices between doom and survival.",
        "III.\nLorinthyrae awoke in a house in the moors\nIn a room lightly furnished except for three doors.\nEllabeth explained that behind one of the doors the lass\nWould find Ellabeth's and her love, the great Nienolas.\nBehind the second lived a ravenous demon.\nAnd behind the third, an exit to freedom.\nShe must choose a door, and to aid her decision\nIf she pondered too long, the axe'd make a division.\nLorinthyrae wept, and Ellabeth felt contrite,\nAnd opened the door to her immediate right.\nIt led to the moors, and as she slipped through the gloom,\nShe advised Lorinthyrae to likewise abandon the room.\nLorinthyrae ignored her and did not feel her will bend.\nNienolas was largely behind the first door she opened.",
        "IV.\nEllabeth had lied; there was no demon of lore.\nThe top third of Nienolas was behind the third door."
