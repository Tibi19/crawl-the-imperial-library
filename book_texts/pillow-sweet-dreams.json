        "Head upon my pillow rest\nSweet dreams play behind my eyes\nI long once more for sleep to come\nFor day would drown me with its lies",
        "My lover lays beside me then\nHer smile bright, her skin aglow\nDeath cannot contain her then\nBut morning comes and she must go",
        "I will sleep once more\nAnd never wake\nMy soul this night\nShall take"
