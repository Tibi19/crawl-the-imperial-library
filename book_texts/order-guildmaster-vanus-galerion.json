        "- Alliance in-fighting will not be tolerated! The Three Banner's War is in Cyrodiil. Here, all Mages are at peace and in harmony.\n- Accept your fellows, no matter their appearance. All the thinking races of Tamriel practice the spellcasting arts. Intolerance towards a fellow guildmember is to be reported to the Guildmaster, and will be dealt with severely!\n- Pay the tithe. Members in good standing are welcome to make use of the isle's sytem of portals for trade and transportation. Any member with a standing business must, however, pay a percentage fee to the guild in tithe.",
