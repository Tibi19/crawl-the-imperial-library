        "I discovered another Scaled Court lair in Upper Craglorn. They have commandeered the Loth'Na Caverns, a series of caves to the northeast of the Skyreach ruins.

(Teasing! I tease!)",
        "I spotted the assassin Visskar entering the Loth'Na Caverns. That tells me that the caves are extremely important to the Scaled Court\u2014and they just got infinitely more dangerous.",
