        "Monologue from The Cursed Duel, Act II, Scene iv\nTranscribed by Relicmaster Glenadir",
        "Battlereeve Tunwinsare: And so I take this cursed sword, knowing that mine enemy shall use it within our dueling grounds. Upon the battle's most vital moment, the blade of his sword shall shatter. It will be then that I shall take the final blow. What I do has no honor, but I feel no shame. What is honor, but a foolish game which we must play upon our lives? I shall know something greater. I shall know the glory of a battle won. Victory still tastes sweet, no matter the means to obtain it."
