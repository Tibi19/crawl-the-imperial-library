        "First thing you have to understand about the Ruddy Fangs is that we're not just thugs, thieves, liars, or murderers; we're all these things. We're the scourge of Elsweyr, the bane of all who try to uphold good in this Moons-forsaken land. And we like to keep it that way.",
        "If you have morals? Get rid of them. A code of ethics, a little nagging conscious telling you to do good in this world? No longer needed. All that's required is the will to get ahead, to do whatever it takes to end up on top. That's the only way you're going to survive.",
        "Our main source of gold is smuggling, both in and out of Elsweyr. You might head up into Cyrodiil with Sugar-Slinger, or work small town cons with Rideza the Rogue. Or perhaps you'll be lucky enough to work odd jobs with me. Whatever the case, you can be sure that gold will soon start lining your purse. Just be sure to not ask questions. The less details you know, the better.",
        "Ah, and one more thing. If you've gotten to the point of reading this helpful little guide, there isn't really any leaving. Well, not alive anyway. So I suggest you get used to your new life, and quick."
