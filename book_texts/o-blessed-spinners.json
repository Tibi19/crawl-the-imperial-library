        "O Blessed Spinners,",
        "My name is Ulthorn, and I am in need of your wisdom. My love has left me. Life is nothing without her. She did not want to go, but it was fate, they said.",
        "I do not believe in fate. How can it exist when a single word can change the path of a story? I have prayed for countless days. For anything\u2014for forgetfulness, for release, for a miracle.",
        "Now I pray to you. Are Gwaering and I doomed to be parted? I would do anything, pay any cost, to be with her again. I would give up a thousand lifetimes to hold her one last time. Please, you must help."
