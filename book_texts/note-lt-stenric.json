        "Chin up, Lieutenant Stenric. I know it's been a long and hard few months, but your vigilance will pay off. Once the invasion begins, we will be able to charge down the mountains and take the enemy completely by surprise. You will be a part of history. And all you need do is hold out a bit longer. Glory is within your reach."
