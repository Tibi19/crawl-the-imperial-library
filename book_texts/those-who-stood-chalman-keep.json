        "Gather 'round, proud warriors all,\nSilent now and standing tall.\nBow your heads to those who sleep,\nBeneath the ground of Chalman Keep.\nThe flames of war seared the land,\nCrushing all with brutal hand.\nDominion soldiers sought the throne,\nChalman, undaunted, stood alone.\nHooves thundered o'er the sward,\nDeath neared for all, swift and hard.\nDefenders stood upon Chalman's wall,\nWarriors brave, Covenant heroes all.\nForward came the Dominion hordes,\nWith arcane spells and gleaming swords.\nWalls shook to siege engines' roars,\nRams thundered upon keep doors.\nThe outer doors fell to the invaders' barrage,\nInto the courtyard Elves and Khajiit charged.\nThe inner door too gave when assaulted,\nO'er bodies and rubble the attackers vaulted.\nThe defenders made their might felt,\nSpells flared forth, death was dealt.\nFury rained upon invaders' heads,\n'til Khajiit and Elves all were dead.\nNo time to rest, no time to heal,\nDoors and breaches they must seal.\nAll was repaired, the damage undone,\nAs another deadly assault was begun.\nOnce again, fierce battle was fought,\nDeath was granted where it was sought.\nEntropy rose inside the keep,\nSwept over all, piled the bodies deep.\nAgain the bloody tide receded,\nDominion foes once more defeated.\nOrc and Redguard and Breton remained,\nProud survivors of Chalman Keep again.\nDominion warriors attacked once more,\nIn numbers far greater than ever before.\nThey battered aside weary defenders,\nStopped only in the innermost chambers.\nInto the apse the heroes were hounded,\nDominion victory cries loudly sounded.\nThen chaos erupted as the Pact swept in,\nSeeing their enemies' forces worn thin.\nCaught between fierce anvil and hammer,\nElf and Khajiit died in brave manner.\nOnly Pact and Covenant soon remained,\nThen the defenders cleared the field again.\nA breath, a pause, a brief respite,\nThe Covenant cause now truly desperate.\nA final assault the Dominion did mount,\nA massive wave, too many to count.\nDetermined to conquer, refusing to desist,\nThe Dominion force impossible to resist.\nThe defenders resolved to fight to the last,\nNo blow was wasted, no spell shoddily cast.\nOne by one the gallant warriors fell,\nBreton, Redguard, and Orc died well.\nTheir lives given up for Chalman Keep,\nThey rest forever in honored sleep.\nThe Dominion banner rose over the hall,\nA Dominion Emperor then ruled over all.\nPeace came to Chalman, damage repaired,\nAttackers dispersed, to other sites they fared.\nThat emperor is gone, his reign long past.\nWhat remains of this day, what of it lasts?\nJust the display of courage, in that final stand,\nOf those who stood, and died, at Chalman"
