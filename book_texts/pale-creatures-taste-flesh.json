        "Stupid underground complex! Stupid delve! Why I let Obor talk me into this job, I'll never understand. Was it the promise of gold? Almost certainly. Did it have anything to do with fame and a possible jarldom? Maybe.",
        "Anyway, it was supposed to be simple enough. Sneak into the caves, look around a bit. Find evidence that these mythological pale creatures with a taste for flesh were real and bring it back to Obor. Collect my reward and earn the adulation of thousands. Right. And I have swampland to sell to an Argonian.",
        "I'm not sure what these things are. I've heard them called Falmer by some old locals. They look like some sort of Goblins to me, but what do I know? Not enough, apparently, because one of the foul monsters took a good chunk out of my side! I'm bleeding like a stuck horker! And now I can hear those damn bugs, too. They're getting closer.",
