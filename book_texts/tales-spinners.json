        "Spinners in Bosmer society play a critical role. More than just a fantastical outlet or a source of catharsis, spinners perform a mystical, priestly function.",
        "If Y'ffre created this world by telling a story, Bosmeri spinners weave new worlds out of their stories, sometimes crafting an illusion so complete that it seems real to the listeners, who are woven into the stories as characters.",
        "Inside these magical stories, spinners can influence their listeners in profound ways, stirring them to empathize with strangers, hate enemies, or have compassion for the suffering.",
        "Of course, spinners who can create complete illusions are rare and often eccentric sorts. Even so, the typical Bosmeri spinner is a storyteller of unmatched talent."
