        "Reinvestment of Battlespire is neither feasible nor desirable at this time. The open provocation and sweet temptation this installation presents to the Daedric Powers is obvious from recent events, and the installation is of no significant value to the maintenance of the Pax Imperia. In light of recent turbulence in the Border Provinces, and considering more pressing demands upon the treasury, we recommend that the gates to Battlespire be sealed indefinitely."
