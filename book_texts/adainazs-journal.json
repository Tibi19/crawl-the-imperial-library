        "Rocks fell, no way out. Henrien doesn't look well. Red-faced and irritable. Threatened to gut this Khajiit. Won't share this one's last rations with him.",
        "Could this be the fabled Great Engine of the Dwemer? It would explain Henrien's condition. Had to tie him down. Won't last long here. Can feel this one's mind slipping. Slipping like Henrien's.",
        "Should destroy infernal machine.",
        "Four power sources. Small chance to use them to overload engine with its own magicka. But need missing control rod.",
        "Couldn't even scratch it with blade. Impervious to any spells this one can cast."
