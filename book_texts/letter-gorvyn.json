        "The trip from Deshaan to Stonefalls was difficult and a little hazardous, but I made it safely. The directions that Dethisam provided me with were perfect. I'll make sure to warn the people here about the Llodos plague. And I'll make sure the healers are ready to deal with the illness\u2014at least as well as they're able. You can count on me!",
        "I hope things are going well at the Serk. Try to stay healthy and I'll see you soon.",
