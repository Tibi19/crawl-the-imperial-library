        "\u2026 says Pell's Gate is in danger, that we should all flee. Some have taken her advice. Eneriell and I have decided to stay. Imperial troops still pass through town on patrols. They keep bandits away.\n*****\n\u2026 took her own advice and left. I don't know what we'll do now, with Brittia gone. Troops pass through only once every few days; bandits are getting bolder. Some seem to be camping in the Homestead ruins to the north. Dehanar swears he saw \u2026.\n*****\n\u2026 hasn't been seen for days. Bandits raided town last night. All our livestock is gone. Haven't seen troops for a week. Eneriell says we have to leave, tonight. We're going to follow Brittia to Vlasta \u2026."
