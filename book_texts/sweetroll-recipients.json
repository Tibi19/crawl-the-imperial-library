        "An associate and other individuals who I heard recently received a threatening sweetroll from the so-called \"Sweetroll Murderer.\" There are probably others, but you can't expect me to do all the work and still get paid.",
        "Dobias: A fellow member of the Gold Coast Trading Company. He's too nice for his own good. Not good at business at all. Probably targeted because of how annoyingly nice he is.",
        "Louna: A feisty woman who married recently but then lost her husband to the Sweetroll Murderer. Now he's targeted her. Such a shame to lose such a tasty dish after she just became available.",
        "Tuindal: Gorgeous eyes and pouty lips that you just want to eat with a spoon. This High Elf probably broke someone's heart. I know he broke mine! Ironically, he's a baker. I wonder who makes the better sweetroll?",
        "Yarmia: Wood Elf beggar. Smells like four-mushroom stew that's been left to rot in the sun. As far as I'm concerned, the Sweetroll Murderer can have this one - stink and all!"
