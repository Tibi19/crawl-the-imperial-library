        "Hey, Zurga,",
        "I'm fed up with spending my days in this hole under Belkarth. I want to get back into the fighting game, challenge myself some, you know? This new arena at Dragonstar sounds like just the thing. But I can't just walk away from this job because I told the Big Boss I'd do it, and he don't like it when one of his people goes back on her word. However, if I had a replacement, I think he'd go for it, so I thought of you\u2014just popped into my mind, and I thought, sure, Zurga's always dreamed about getting out of the stronghold, seeing the world and all. Now I know what you're thinking, but come on\u2014even if old Snurbash got stomped by a mammoth tomorrow, Godrun's still not going to take you as his new Hunt-Wife. So do a sister a favor, and come on out to Belkarth. You'd like it here.",
