        "\u2014transcribed from the oral tradition by an unknown author\u2014\nSing, Valenwood, shout Green\nTell the tale of the mover, the shaper,\nthe one, the Wilderking.\nHis eye projects outward to the world\nand touches everything he perceives:\nby his thoughts he shapes it.\nDo you know where to find him?\nHave you looked to the hills?\nHave you looked to the trees?\nHe is not there.\nBecause \"there\" is a place, and a place has boundaries,\nbut The Wilderking is boundless.\nHis is the Court and the Throne.\nHe is the Court and the Throne.\nWhen he walks, his footfalls fall on himself.\nAnd who does not hear his footfalls and quake?\nThe earth shakes at his coming,\nat the rising of his Hollow from the earth.\nLike the delicate calm of an undisturbed pool\nis shattered by the smallest of stones,\nso is the terrible force of the Wilderking's passing.\nShout, Bramblebreach! Wail, Shadows Watch!\nThe Wilderking is friend and foe,\nFoe and friend to both.\nFor who can record his footsteps on the land,\nwho can hear the melody of his voice,\nwhen he opens his mouth to sing?"
