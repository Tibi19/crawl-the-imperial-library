        "I tried to explain, but he doesn't understand how much we could learn out there! That there is so much more than the lives of those who went before! New methods to be discovered! Secrets!",
        "Instead, he clings to the past. He makes his brew the way his mother did, and her father before her. Never changing, never experimenting. It's sickening!",
        "I even summoned an atronach to demonstrate what is possible, but he left it in some musty cavern with some jerked mammoth and Y'ffre knows what other refuse he's dredged out of the forest.",
        "He'll learn his lesson soon enough, though. Without regular bindings, even the lowliest atronach is prone to rebellion."
