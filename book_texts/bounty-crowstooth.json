        "Rumor has it that Forsworn raiding parties have been pushing further and further east, along the Jerall Mountains. The arrival of Legate Fasendil has prevented further incursions, but they failed to apprehend their leader, Crowstooth.",

        "While Crowstooth has been separated from her forces, she is believed to have fled with considerable spoils. In an effort to put an end to this threat, anyone killing Crowstooth may claim her stolen loot.",

        "Mercenaries, like infamous sell-sword Bjormund Wind-Strider, have been seen heading into the mountains beyond Darklight Tower. While they could be after the treasure, it is feared Crowstooth is gathering these forces for a renewed assault. We ask any capable warriors for their aid in dealing with this potential threat.",
