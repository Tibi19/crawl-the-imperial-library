        "I am proud to report that our group has successfully infiltrated the Hunting Grounds, the details of which I will speak of upon my return. When I shall return, however, is unknown. Upon Balorgh's insistence, our group has remained within Hircine's realm for over a week now.",
        "The Orc insists that we need to keep scouting in an effort to find Hircine's weakness, but I distrust such motives. Whenever I remind him of your orders, he simply snaps at me. His excuses grow weaker, and I fear he may be searching for something else. Perhaps something that may even cause harm to you.",
        "I will continue my observations, as well as my reports.",
