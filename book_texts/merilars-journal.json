        "What does he mean about me not being right in the head?\u00a0 There's nothing wrong with me.\u00a0 He's the one trying to steal my discovery! Does he think I don't see what he's doing? There's nothing wrong with me. Nothing!",

        "It doesn't matter. He'll see what real power is. The chanting we heard just outside the main chamber must mean there's something extremely powerful there. If I can get my hands on that energy and bring it back, who knows what kind of discoveries we can make from it."
