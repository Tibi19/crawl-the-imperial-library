        "By Lights-the-Way, Mystic of the Mages Guild",
        "It is hard to describe the culture of my people. Often my tongue stumbles as I try to explain, but it is my hope that ink and quill will give me time enough to gather my thoughts. And perhaps, though such writing, I will finally connect the parts of me that now feel so divided; my homeland of Murkmire and my new life within the Mages Guild.",
        "These journals are to become my ku-vastei. And, as I write that, I can think of no better topic to begin with.",
        "Ku-vastei roughly translates to \"the catalyst of needed change,\" though such a direct translation in no way does justice to the original meaning. Another translation could be \"that which creates the needed pathway for change to occur\" or even \"the spark which ignites the flame which must come into being.\"",
        "Perhaps a more direct analysis should be first presented. Ku-vastei is a noun, a thing or person. Vastei directly translates to change, an important part of my culture. Ku is harder to speak of. It is that which leads to change, though not that which creates change. An important role, as stagnation is a fate worse than death.",
        "Take a boulder which sits atop a cliff, teetering in place. It must fall eventually. The ku-vastei does not push the boulder off the cliff; rather, it picks the pebble which holds the rock in place. And so it falls, not by a push, but by a pathway cleared.",
        "Ku-vastei is revered, just as change itself is revered, for to look back at what was means to stumble as you move forward. Sometimes, a little push in the right direction is all someone needs to remember such wisdom. Other times, they may need to be shoved."
