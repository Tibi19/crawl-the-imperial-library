        "To add a level of authenticity to our cover, I've hired a number of foreign mercenaries to act as special advisors. Each has years of experience in privateering or piracy. Listen to them. They'll teach you how to appear to be a genuine raider. The better our cover, the longer we can operate without drawing the Dominion's attention.",
        "These mercenaries are to be shown the utmost respect. Failure to do so will result in immediate disciplinary action. You'll think Mehrunes Dagon himself came at you.",
