        "There are two slightly different versions of this book. In the alternate text, Jofnir travels to the Baandari Caravan rather than Windhelm. Texts are otherwise completely identical.",
        "",
        "I've done all I can. For now, I've salvaged what I could of the situation. Took a few relics as trophies. I should be back out in the light soon enough.",
        "I can put these lessons to good use the next time I visit Ragnthar. The Dwemer constructs will set watch, keep the place safe. I don't want any visitors. The next time we meet, I'm going to end this. I can't let this go on any longer.",
        "I'll stop in Windhelm, see if I can't get a few supplies for the next trip. Maybe some mead. It's been far too long since I had a decent brew."
