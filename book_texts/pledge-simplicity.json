        "Seek simplicity and abstain from profane pleasures. You must not wallow, as beasts do, in filth and mire. Nor should you dwell in a house of gold and blessed red stone. In all things seek cleanliness and austerity. Do not share the cup of the debauched or break bread at the lot-caster's table. Simple blades must be clean and sharp. For a simple warrior is an unburdened warrior, ready for whatever comes his way.",
