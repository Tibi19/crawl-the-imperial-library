        "The Orsimer bellowing drum, King Thunder, is renowned for both its bass tone and the sheer volume it produces. The Orcs prize drums for both celebration and war, creating complex rhythms as the foundation for their warlike rituals.",
        "This drum was hidden during the Siege of Orsinium and eventually made its way to Yashnag gro-Yazgu's stronghold in Falkreath. The drum was presented to the college by Jarl Hakkvild to commemorate his victory over Chief Yashnag and his champions."
