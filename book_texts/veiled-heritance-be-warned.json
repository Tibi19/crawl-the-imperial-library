        "It has come to our attention that a group of political activists known as the \"Veiled Heritance\" has engaged in thievery and the fencing of stolen goods in this area.",
        "While the Shadow Artisans normally welcome kindred spirits, this group's recent anti-Dominion activities have not gone unnoticed by Queen Ayrenn's agents. We suspect that drawing the attention of the Eyes of The Queen upon our own operations would be foolish and unnecessarily risky.",
        "We therefore request all associates refrain from any and all dealings with this group. Their business is not welcome, and the presence of their operatives\u2014or anyone associating with same\u2014will not be tolerated.",
