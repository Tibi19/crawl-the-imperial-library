        "The Soul Shriven shriek and writhe in Coldharbour. The Harvester of Souls digests them, makes them mutter and despair. They whisper their secrets to the dead winds of Oblivion, and those with ears attuned will know them and use them.",
        "Gather the implements\nA steel needle, nightshade, frost salts\nThe crushed bone of a sacrifice\nSplintered tooth of a daedroth",

        "Prepare the body:\nCreate a draught of bone and tooth and hold it in the mouth. Inscribe the names and symbols on the flesh of the palms.",
        "Open the gate:\nPlace the needle in the left ear's entrance. Insert so slowly as barely to move. Worldly sounds make way for the cries and secret dreams of the slaves in Coldharbour.\n",
