        "Scales of shadow, hands of death\nSithis honored by your blade\nTo create the needed change\nBy the blood which must be spilt",
        "You who join the brotherhood\nGuided by just one untruth\nRemember our nothing words\nLook upon with nothing eyes",
        "One day, when your snout is pale\nTo the swamps you will return\nDarkness remains in your heart\nFor your scales are shadow still"
