        "Dear Citizen Agapitus,",
        "Your petition for admission into the Mages Guild is yet again denied. This is not an institution into which one can buy their way, contrary to your intimations. You lack the most basic of magical aptitude, in defiance of our minimal requirements and even logic.",
        "We request that you cease correspondence and attempts to badger our representatives when they come through your township. The Mages Guild is a society for the gifted and the scholarly, not the wealthy and inept.",
        "Sincerely,\nEvoker-Adept Carusian"
