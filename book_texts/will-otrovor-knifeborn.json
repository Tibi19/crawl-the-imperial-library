        "At the insistence of the ever-worried Keera, I am writing a will. She feels we head into grave danger, from which we may never return. I think the rumors of hauntings and undead hordes are overblown. We've faced undead before; even Philien no longer wets himself at the sight of skeletons. Those we dispatched outside the cave are probably the worst we'll face.",
        "But, to make Keera happy \u2026.",
        "To my brother Wilvor, currently living in Bruma, I leave all my possessions, except our father's sword, which he is unworthy to wield. I want that buried with my ashes. There, done.",
