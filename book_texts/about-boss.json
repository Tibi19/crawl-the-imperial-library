        "He's damn useful in a fight, but I'm tired of his plans. They stink.",
        "If things don't change, some of us are planning to leave. You should leave with us. As long as that moron is in charge, we're all going to end up in a jail or dead.",
        "And be careful who you trust. If the Boss finds out what we've got planned, he'll probably kill one of us as an example to the others. Maybe me. Maybe you.",
