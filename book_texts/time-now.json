        "Time is immediate. The clash of arms, the roar of victory, the grief and tragedy of defeat \u2026 they all happen now. Moment-to-moment the world exists, or it doesn't. The past, the future; none are more important than the present.",
        "I am forever free, regardless of whether the Hound's spell binds my body. Release me from my bonds if you will, knowing that what happens now is most important. Death is just another moment in time, and when it comes, I will endure it.",
        "The Lady stands alone,\nHer will by rituals besieged.\nThe Warrior stands alone,\nHis strength by liars mocked.\nThe Lord stands alone,\nHis rule by traitors taken."
