        "This series will provide a survey-level overview of the symbolic and stylistic hallmarks that distinguish the major cultures of Tamriel in their arts and crafts. Our focus will be on the portable durable goods of the various races, that is, their clothing, ornamentation, arms, and armor, as these reliably reflect personal cultural expressions. When completed, this series will support the curricula of the introductory ethnographic courses at the Arcane University.",
        "We begin with the High Elves, the reclusive Altmer of the Summerset Isles, because the argument can be made (and often is, by Elves) that civilization in Tamriel was brought here by the Aldmeri of Old Ehlnofey. Insofar as the Elves of Summerset consciously strive to maintain the heritage of their Merethic ancestors, their traditions are certainly closer to those of pre-First Era society than any other.",
        "This is not to say that, in the thousands of years since the arrival of the first Aldmeri, the culture of the High Elves has not deviated and ramified in many ways, because it has. It is simply that, by viewing modern Altmeri culture with the eye of a historian, we can perceive the outlines of its origins.",
        "In this initial effort I have benefited from the advice of the celebrated Morian Zenas, Professor of Transliminal Studies here at Arcane University. Professor Zenas is the only member of our faculty who has visited the Summerset Isles, specifically Artaeum, with a brief stop in transit at Dusk.",
        "I was a bit intimidated when I first visited Professor Zenas in his house in the Cathedral District, but I found him a charming old gentleman, undeserving of his reputation for peevishness. Morian (for so he asked me to address him) bade me stay for dinner, which was served by his laconic Argonian apprentice, Seif-ij Hidja.",
        "As Morian explained, the High Elves strive for a simple elegance in their designs, in which flowing lines reflect graceful forms from the natural world. More-or-less abstract birds, flowers, and sea shells are common motifs, rendered in rich but muted colors. Armor will be tooled or embossed to represent scales or feathers, and even heavy cuirasses and helmets may sport stylized wings or beaks.",
        "Metallic items are often accented with a translucent greenish material called \"glass.\" This is a sort of jade-like obsidian that Elven smiths have learned to work by secretive processes known only to the Altmer. Though rigid enough to take a superb edge when cool, glass can be made malleable enough to assume almost any form, and the High Elves use it extensively on ornamental arms and armor.",
        "After dinner, over snifters of Cyrodilic Brandy, Morian asked me all sorts of questions about my motifs project, and about myself. It was really very flattering. I must find an excuse to talk with him again.",

        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "",
        "From the High Elves it is natural to next consider the Dark Elves, as they originated in the Summerset Isles before their migration to Morrowind. Their culture can thus be considered an offshoot of the Altmeri, though in many ways that of the Dunmer is a reaction to that of Summerset rather than an extension.",
        "Also, Morian introduced me to a Dark Elven associate of his, Divayth Fyr, who is helping him on his \"transliminal sojourn\" project. I don't know what that's all about, but Divayth offered to help me with references on Dunmeri culture, and I accepted.",
        "Elegance is as much a goal for the Dark Elves as it is for the High Elves, but beyond that their styles could not be more different. Morrowind is a far harsher environment than fair Summerset, and that rigor is reflected in Dunmeri designs. The Dark Elves also draw on nature for their inspiration, but in place of avian and floral motifs, Dunmeri artifice draws on the curved and spiky forms of the carapaces of the giant insects that inhabit Morrowind. Elegant these are, but also fearsome, a constant reminder that the Dunmer daily fight for their very existence.",
        "Ebony is the favored metal for Dark Elven heavy armor, but even in their lighter armors and shields, steel and steel alloys are often lacquered in dark tones to appear ebony-like. Clothing, armor included, is often accented by flaring extensions at shoulder, crest, or hip, with overlapping geometric designs that may have been borrowed from Dwarven culture, though Divayth bristled at the idea of any Dwemeri influence on the Dunmer.",
        "In truth, I find the dark sorcerer from Vvardenfell exerts a strangely compelling attraction. He doesn't seem old, but he referred to Morian, who is at least sixty, as a \"young man.\" I wonder how old he really is. In fact, I wonder many things about him. He has those crimson eyes that seem to look right through you. It's a little bit thrilling.",
        "He's offered to take me with him to visit a Bosmeri tavern down on the waterfront. I may do it.",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 3: Wood Elf Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "Next we complete our study of the Elves with the Bosmer of Valenwood. Though less influential in the world at large than their cousins the High Elves and the Dark Elves, the Wood Elves outnumber all other Mer in Tamriel, being relatively fecund (for Elves) and more, shall we say, amorously-inclined.",
        "It's a commonplace to point out that the Wood Elves favor natural motifs, but as I learned, there's more to it than that. Their reverence for Y'ffre and the story of the Earth Bones is reflected in the stylized fashion in which these natural motifs are represented. The Bosmer believe that all nature was in chaos before Y'ffre gave all plants, animals, and people their names, which defined the permanent form each species would take. Thus each species is depicted by a particular, idealized motif which represents the ur-form it was given by Y'ffre.",
        "This is reflected in the designs that appear everywhere on Wood Elven arts, crafts, and clothing. These designs are drawn from a large repertoire, as there is a design for each species of plant and animal in the Bosmer's world, but the use and depiction of these designs is culturally prescribes, and there is very little room for variation. Unorthodox usage of these stylized pictograms is considered improper, just plain \"wrong.\"",
        "This may seem paradoxical in a race whose members otherwise seem so carefree and easygoing, but it is so, as I had an opportunity to see for myself. There are quite a few Wood Elves in the Imperial City, enough that there is a small Bosmeri neighborhood down on the waterfront, served by a tavern called the Tipsy Torchbug. Divayth Fyr, the fascinating Dark Elf wizard assisting Morian Zenas in his experiments, had offered to take me there, and I agreed.",
        "When I arrived at Morian's house on the date of our jaunt to the docks the old professor himself answered the door, and I was surprised when he asked me to step into my study for a moment. Also surprising was the way Morian was turned out: in a new silk robe sporting star-sign symbols, hair trimmed and combed, and smelling faintly of lavender. Quite a transformation from the disreputable, singed and stained robes I'd seen him in previously.",
        "It turned out he wanted to caution me about going down to the waterfront with Divayth Fyr. I'm afraid I laughed, at which he reddened, and I then told him I was a grown woman who could take care of herself. He was somewhat abashed and muttered some excuses, from which I gathered that he was more concerned about my spending time with Divayth than going to the docks. I didn't want his feelings hurt, so I complimented his new robe, at which he beamed, and then I went to the parlor to meet Divayth.",
        "I shouldn't ramble on, but we had a wonderful evening. The Tipsy Torchbug was a lively place, and Divayth introduced me to Lady Biniele, the proprietor, who insisted that we share our table. The entertainment was Biniele's Bosmeri Burlesque, which was hilarious, and though I couldn't drink any of the Wood Elves' revolting beverages, I did consent to share a pipeful of bugsmoke with Divayth, which made me feel strangely exhilarated.",
        "It also led to my seeing a prime example of Bosmeri disdain for \"improper design\" when a Leyawiin sailor, who'd seen me sharing Divayth's pipe, offered to sell me a carved-bone pipe of \"genuine Valenwood make.\" Lady Biniele told me it was a counterfeit and not to waste my money. The sailor protested, but the diminutive Wood Elf woman told him any fool could see the tail was wrong on the Imga carved on the bowl, and he should shove off. Which he did.",
        "Divayth and I shoved off shortly thereafter, and on our way back up to the city gates he pointed to the stars in the brilliant night sky and told me the ancient Chimeri names for the constellations. I must confess, I remember nothing but the warm tones of his resonant voice\u2014and the warm touch of his hand on my arm.",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 4: Nord Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "We come now to the Nords, the first human culture on Tamriel to successfully resist, and even displace, Elven hegemony on the continent.",
        "Not unlike the Bosmer, the Nords rely heavily on stylized, often interlocking natural motifs in their architecture, crafts, and clothing. However, where the Wood Elves' designs are mainly floral, the Nords emphasize animals, in particular the eight \"totem\" animals of the old Atmoran religion: wolf, hawk, whale, snake, moth, fox, and so forth. They also allow for much more variation of design, to the point where some of the animal motifs are so abstract they are difficult to recognize. Indeed, areas of trim are often filled with interlocking geometric designs that evoke nothing natural at all.",
        "Nord design varies in other ways from that of the Elves as well, in general relying on simple, heavy yet dynamic forms where Elven work would be slender, elegant, and understated. Nothing the Nords make is understated, ever.",
        "This was clear even from outside the Imperial City's Skyrim Embassy, where Morian, Divayth and I had gone to a reception for King Logrolf. The lintel above the embassy doors was crowned with a great iron hawk's-head, its mouth open as if screaming defiance, while the doors were flanked by bas-reliefs of hawks so stylized they looked as much like axes as they did birds. The door itself was dark oak, banded with iron and studded with iron rivets, as if they expected to have to repel an attack.",
        "The inside of the embassy was less martial in appearance, at least once one got past the armed and armored guards inside the door. I wondered if they really needed to wear full helms sporting ram's-horns in order to check the invitations of party guests, but the look in the Nords' eyes didn't exactly invite questions.",
        "The party, as I said, was a reception for King Logrolf, visiting the Imperial City to pay his respects to the Potentate. Morian was there representing the Arcane University; he'd asked me to accompany him and I'd accepted, eager to see our fierce northern cousins in their own environment. When Divayth learned where we were going he'd attached himself to our party, in spite of Morian's baleful glare, but once we were inside the embassy and he was surrounded by loud, boisterous Nords, the Dark Elf wizard seemed to be regretting his decision to join us.",
        "Not so Morian! After he'd downed a flagon of mead, I was suddenly seeing a new Professor Zenas. Attired in his new robe, he positively bloomed, holding forth on the history of magic to an admiring crowd of diplomats, whom he enthralled with tales of the feats of wizardry of the Nord Arch-Mage Shalidor. He seemed twenty years younger, and I suddenly saw him as he must have been in his prime, when he first came to the Imperial City to help found the Arcane University.",
        "Morian even introduced me to King Logrolf, though how he came to know the monarch of Skyrim I have no idea. When I looked around for Divayth, he was nowhere to be seen. Morian and I stayed late at the embassy, quaffing mead and laughing at the Nords' hearty jokes. When we finally left and he walked me home, I thought I could see a new gleam in Morian's eye.",
        "He may have seen the same gleam in mine.",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 5: Breton Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "The Arch-Magister at the University, Lady Opel Dantaine, is a Breton, so I consulted with her on Breton motifs. She was friendly, and very helpful.",
        "The Bretons were the last major group of humans on Tamriel to free themselves from their Elven overlords, and in many ways their long vassalage to the Direnni defines their culture. They are fiercely autonomous, each kingdom in High Rock jealous of its individual sovereignty, but Breton society retains a feudal structure that hearkens back to the rank-obsessed Direnni Hegemony. The Bretons are nearly as fractious as their cousins the Nords, but their long tutelage under the Elves makes them open to the magical arts, rather than suspicious of them.",
        "How is this reflected in their arts and crafts? Let's look at Breton armor, for example. The gleaming heavy armor of a Breton knight is as tough and practical as that of a Nord housecarl, but its pleasing form exhibits a subtle sophistication that is reminiscent of Elven elegance. One sees the same influence in Breton weaponry, which is beautiful yet undeniably deadly.",
        "It made me think of the differences between Divayth's Elven urbanity and Morian's breadth of knowledge and all-too-human inconsistencies, even peevishness. Apparently the transliminal experiments have not been going well. When I stopped by the townhouse last night, neither Morian nor Divayth were in\u2014Seif-ij, Morian's apprentice, told me they'd quarreled over the appropriate price to pay a transporting entity to ensure safe return from a jaunt to Oblivion, the remarks became personal, and then my name was apparently brought up. There was shouting, and they both huffed their way out of the laboratory and marched off down Divines Street in opposite directions.",
        "This is terrible. Fighting? Over me? I must confess I was so disturbed I blurted out the whole thing to Lady Opel, who was incredibly kind and solicitous. She asked me if I had feelings for either of the two wizards, and I admitted I did, but they were conflicting and confusing. Opel opened a bottle of two of Bangkorai spiced wine, and we got quite confidential with each other as the evening waned. I'm not sure how I got home, and today my head hurts, but it was worth it, as my heart is no longer so heavy.",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 6: Redguard Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "When I arrived at Morian's townhouse this morning all was sunshine and rainbows\u2014Divayth and the professor were chatting over mugs of chal like best friends, comparing Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms to the Book of Most Arcane Covenants. I reminded Divayth that he'd promised to escort me to the Yokudan Chapel in the Market District, at which Morian's brow clouded over slightly, but then he smiled and said that was fine, as he wanted to test some new hyperagonal media in his laboratory.",
        "(And maybe it was the light, but to me both men looked \u2026 younger, somehow. I must keep in mind that they're both highly capable wizards, which I suppose might include knowledge of illusion magic. Or perhaps I flatter myself.)",
        "I met a number of knowledgeable Redguards at the chapel, all exhibiting that dignity and polite reserve I associate with the better-educated members of that people. The Most-Revered Zirumir, a Priest of Tu'whacca (I hope I spelled that right), was particularly helpful.",
        "As Zirumir pointed out, both the Redguards' ancient home of Yokuda and their current province of Hammerfell are (or were, in the case of Yokuda) deserts. To stay cool, and for protection from the elements, Redguard clothing tends to be light, long and flowing, and these flowing curves are carried into their artisanal designs. Their robes and armor are often accented by flared curves at joints and on headgear. Even their swords tend to be curved.\nIn contrast their architecture appears rather heavy, though on close inspection this is mainly for the purpose of insulation from the desert's extremes of temperature. Zirumir showed me the chapel's clever system of louvered ventilation ducts in the clerestory, designed to catch the slightest breeze and funnel it down into the nave.",
        "After Zirumir was called away to tend to one of his congregation, Divayth and I strolled into the apse to view the eight shrines to the Yokudan Divines. Divayth was explaining that whereas the Forebears of Hammerfell often worship the Cyrodilic Divines brought to them by the Reman Empire, these were the traditional gods worshiped by the more conservative Crown Redguards. Suddenly, behind the beehive shrine to Morwha, he turned to me with those blazing eyes, took my hands between his, and told me he thought me the most brilliant and desirable woman in the Imperial City. My breath caught in my throat, and my heart was hammering. But when he moved as if to embrace me I was suddenly frightened\u2014I backed away, shaking my head, then fled out into the nave. I fear I quite startled a young family of Redguards placing candles on Morwha's altar.",
        "Now what? I'm afraid I must have insulted Divayth terribly. How can I make it up to him? And dare I mention it to Morian? Julianos' little teapot, what a dilemma!",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 7: Khajiit Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "When I went to the professor's townhouse this morning, my first priority was to apologize to Divayth, but Seif-ij told me he was out\u2014he'd gone somewhere from the portal chamber, using an incantation and leaving nothing behind but a burnt smell. Onward, I told myself: work will take your mind off it. So I went looking for Morian.",
        "I found the old dear at breakfast, just finishing his sweet roll and chal. When I entered the kitchen, he nearly knocked over his mug in his haste to stand up and bow! I told him I wanted to make some notes on the Khajiit and asked him if he knew any of the Cat-Folk, as I did not. He said he knew exactly the person I needed and would be delighted to help me, since \"that irascible Telvanni\" had taken the day off.",
        "I had often passed the seasonal camp of the Baandari Pedlars outside the Market Gate but had never gone in\u2014residual caution from my father's warnings keeping me out, I suppose, as well as the pungent scent. Besides, I've always been a dog person. But Morian plunged right in without hesitation and led me to a pavilion adorned with colorful prayer-flags. I followed Morian into the tent, where he introduced me to Madame Shizahi-jo, whom he said was a Khajiiti sorceress devoted to Azurah and Magrus. Though sitting in lotus position, she bowed politely\u2014the Cat-Folk are lissome\u2014gestured to a pair of seat cushions, and asked how \"this one\" could be of service.",
        "We had a long and lovely chat. There are superficial similarities between the motifs and designs of the Khajiit and the Redguards, perhaps because they both inhabit hot, arid environments, but where the Redguards favor long, flowing curves, the Cat-Folk are devoted to circular and crescentiform moon-shapes. The shapes of Masser and Secunda in all their phases appear everywhere on Khajiiti clothing and ornaments. The falcate sliver of the crescent moon also brings to mind the Khajiiti claws that spring from pads in their hands and feet, a subtle but ever-present threat to softer folk.",
        "Shizahi-jo made us some tea\u2014sticky sweet, like all Khajiiti food and drink\u2014then asked to see the leaves in the bottom of my cup. She stirred them with her pinky-claw, and said now she saw the object of my concern: I'd let my fear cloud my longing and darken my heart. I blurted something about how Divayth had tried to kiss me, and Morian dropped his cup, splattering poor Shizahi.",
        "I thought he was going to explode in rage, but instead this sad look came over him, and then he began pouring out his heart about his feelings for me. It was so sweet of him. I was really quite moved. The Khajiiti mage made a discreet exit, and we stayed on her cushions, talking, for what seemed like hours.",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 8: Orc Style</title>",
        "Being notes by Doctor Alfidia Lupus for a series of pamphlets on the major cultural styles of Tamriel",
        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "I saw Divayth last night, briefly, at the Torchbug. I told him I truly cared for him, but that Morian had won my heart. He clouded over like a storm in the Jeralls, but then took a deep breath and managed a dignified exit. Oh, I do hope he'll be all right.",
        "Though I confess, I'm more worried about Morian. His experiments with Divayth are reaching their climax, when Morian will open a gate and personally make a visit to Oblivion. He says he's going to try for Azura's realm of Moonshadow, as he says that ought to be relatively safe. Safe! I'm as anxious as a scrib on a griddle. I dearly want to see Morian before he goes, but he says he must concentrate on mastering the ritual and can't be interrupted.",
        "He did send a note by Seif-ij saying I should take his place representing the University at the Potentate's state dinner for the new envoy from Orsinium. He must really be busy to skip that event, as I know he was keen to go. Well, all the better for my Racial Motifs project, I suppose\u2014work, work, work will take my mind off my worries!",
        "The new province of Orsinium doesn't have an embassy yet, so for the dinner the Potentate's snake-staff set up a row of pavilions on the grounds of the White-Gold Tower. To honor Envoy Thuggikh they were all decorated with authentic Orcish paraphernalia imported from Wrothgar, so I got out my journal and took notes during the interminable speeches.",
        "Strange to think that a folk as brutish as the Orcs seem to be could design and create objects of such sophistication! Of course they're known across Tamriel as fine armorers, but I'd always assumed that was due to their great strength rather than skill. A glance at their arms and armor was enough to show me how wrong my assumption had been. Though never ornate or over-embellished, their metalwork, though even simpler and more utilitarian than the Nords', displays a deep understanding of the laws of proportion, symmetry, and harmonic congruity. An Orcish sword may be a weapon of violence, but to contemplate the dynamic sweep of its blade, visually balanced by its heavy but shapely hilt, obviously molded to flow into the hand of its wielder\u2014why, it's almost restful and reassuring.",
        "Afterwards at the reception I was happy to see somebody I recognized in Lady Opel the Arch-Magister. She greeted me warmly and, over some West Weald wine and Eidar cheese, asked me how things were going with me and my pair of wizards. I told her I thought I'd made a terrible muddle of things, but she assured me everything would work out in the end. She said she's known Morian for ever so long, and he's really quite sensible beneath his fussy old-man ways. She was glad he'd found someone as clever as I to keep him from completely vanishing into his laboratory.",
        "But as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what he's done. I think I'll go talk to Seif-ij again\u2014maybe he can help me get through to Morian before he leaves.",

        "(Dr. Lupus was Imperial Ethnographer for Potentate Savirien-Chorak from 2E 418 to 431)",
        "This morning my maid Dariella came to me all a-twitter with the news that there was a lizard-woman at the door, asking for me and insisting it was urgent. There aren't many Argonians in the City, and it occurred to me this might be a relative of Seif-ij, sent with some dreadful news about Morian, so I donned my University robe and hurried down.",
        "There was indeed a young lizard-woman waiting in the street, clad in a fetching spidersilk jumper adorned with intricate spiral designs. She said her name was Lifts-Her-Tail (which I thought must be a joke, but who can tell, given these reptilians' impassive features), and she'd been sent to bring me to her master, Desh-Wulm the Perspicuous. She said she didn't know what it was about, but it was a matter of some urgency, and she was to lead me to her master immediately. I nodded, nervously, and followed.",
        "The Argonian lass led me out the Temple gate and down to the Docks, far out on the end of which we found a curious old house I'd never before noticed, with a dark sign by the door that read \"The Xanmeer\"\u2014a word unfamiliar to me. We went inside to find a large house entirely occupied by Argonians, a dozen or so who seemingly lived there using all the rooms in common. Everywhere I looked I saw Argonian hangings, sculptures, and fetishes, all made from natural materials such as shells, bone, and feathers, glowing with bright spiral and geometric designs. If these objects were representative of what the Argonians used in their home regions, then snakeskin, tortoise shell, jagged teeth, turquoise and jade, all of which we would consider exotic materials, must be commonplace in Black Marsh,.",
        "Lifts-Her-Tail led me up a ramp that had apparently replaced the house's staircase. On the upper level she introduced me to a humid room that, to me at least, smelled of decay and mold. Coughing, I entered, discovering a room almost entirely full of potted jungle plants\u2014some of them seemingly long-dead and rotting. I stepped on something that squished beneath my sandal and stepped involuntarily back, but the lizard-lass gently took my hand, drew me past a wall of ferns and into the center of the room.",
        "There, incongruously, I discovered a large porcelain Nibenese bathtub, like the one in my own vanity chamber, though this one was filled almost to the rim with a noisome, greenish mud. And lying in this mud, nose barely above the surface, was the oldest Argonian I'd ever seen.",
        "In fact, the withered and wizened lizard-man looked so much like a mummy I was startled when it opened its mouth and spoke. In a voice like creaking leather, the reptilian slowly said, \"I am Desh-Wulm. You are Al-Phid, Brightest Star of the City. You are welcome in my uxith\u2014my nest.\"",
        "He seemed to be looking someplace over my shoulder, and I saw that the old lizard's eyes were clouded over with an opalescent film\u2014he was blind. This infirmity was somehow reassuring, enabling me to regain my self-possession and fall gratefully into the routines of etiquette. I bowed\u2014though he couldn't see it\u2014and said, \"I am honored to be received into your home, venerable Desh-Wulm. How can one such as I be of service to an Elder of Wisdom?\"",
        "\"You can beware!\" he croaked, scaled hands emerging from the mud and levering him up on the rim of the bathtub. \"Your dryskin mages\u2014the weft unravels about them,\" he said, more calmly, making an unfamiliar spiral gesture above the tub. \"It is wrong. The Aurbic skeins should not be disjoined with intent of malice.\"",
        "I had been around wizards long enough to guess at what he meant. \"Morian?\" I gasped. \"And Divayth? They're in danger? What can I do?\"",
        "Desh-Wulm clacked his jaws twice, and then said, \"You are capable. You must stop them. You will prevail. If not,\" three sharp spines rose up from his brow, \"there will be ill dreams and serration for all who swim the river. Kaoc!\" The old Argonian suddenly began thrashing about in the tub, spilling muck over the sides. \"Theilul!\"",
        "Lifts-Her-Tail deftly picked up a jug that seemed to be made from a single insect's carapace, uncorked it, and poured some brown liquor down the old lizard-man's throat. \"Go!\" she hissed, pointing toward the door. \"Do as he says! Now!\"\nI turned, ran out of the room, down the ramp, out the door, and back to the Imperial City.",

        "",
        "I feel no need to point out to my readers that scholars of Argonian cultural mores come by the bushel. The recent mania in our scholarly community to expose \"\"dark secrets\"\" of the beast race in the swamps has led to such trite revelations as \"\"On Crunchy Bugs and Moist Spines- An Investigation into Gustatory Practices of Southern Argonians.\"\" However, during a recent sojourn through Blackwood, I encountered a tribe with a culture so distinct that I felt compelled to document it. After my entourage graciously cut down several of these Sul-Xan, I collected their effects. What follows are descriptions of the materials and methods of construction which appear unique to this group.",
        "",
        "AXES",
        "Atop the long, narrow hilt, each of these weapons display a half-moon shaped blade unlike others I've seen. On each side of the blade, two silvery spikes jut out menacingly. However, these are not merely ornamental. I personally witnessed their tearing abilities upon several guards once the curved blade nearly cut them in twain.",
        "",
        "BELTS",
        "Primarily constructed from what I believe is thick haj mota leather, Sul-Xan belts offer a great deal of support when carrying multiple heavy weapons. The buckles appear fashioned from basic steel, but the iconography etched on them must require a sharp eye and steady hand.",
        "",
        "BOOTS",
        "I regret that my time trudging through the swamps left mud caked within my every pore. So, when I see the Sul-Xan footwear has an open-toed design, I admit my bafflement. Perhaps the claws of the tribe are especially sharp? The supple leather structure does offer impressive support on the calf area. I imagine they find it helpful while chasing down prey as it flees at high speed.",
        "",
        "BOWS",
        "Our group once stumbled upon a small Sul-Xan encampment to our surprise. Once the villains were no longer a threat, I discovered their bows are strung using alit sinew, finely stretched and dried across several bone racks. The delicate recurve of the bow limbs strangely conflicts with the garish metal adornments on the riser.",
        "",
        "CHEST PIECES",
        "No surprise that such a vicious people focus on defending sensitive vital body areas. Even the lighter armors have metal plating protecting the chest and gut. Every piece is also quite tight-fitting, so that nothing can be snagged during battle. Intricate scale plating underlies dark leather, providing extra protection.",
        "",
        "DAGGERS",
        "Mention a dagger, and I think of the pocket blade I carried when I left home the first time. For Sul-Xan, a dagger means the length of a dragon's tooth. While basic in construction\u2014simple steel blade and leather grip\u2014the size is quite enormous.",
        "",
        "GLOVES",
        "Much like the boots, Sul-Xan gloves are opened to bare the claws. Argonian fighters always have one last line of defense should they lose a weapon. Along the top of the wrist and forearm, they have placed a thick metal brace to prevent the loss of the combatant's sharp claws.",
        "",
        "HELMETS",
        "Each headpiece holds a scowling death mask carved from a bright jade. If the intent is to intimidate, they succeed. Some will sport massive curving horns like the claws of some great crab. In the interest of academics, I admit that when I close my eyes, these faces haunt me still.",
        "",
        "LEG GREAVES",
        "Aesthetically simple, yet functionally perfect. The flexible leather surrounds the leg providing excellent range of motion. But the dull metal brace across the shin offers protection from severing. I imagine the knee spikes can also do vicious damage during intense melee.",
        "",
        "MACES",
        "The Sul-Xan imagination for their maces does not seem to have gone much further than \"\"heavy and hard.\"\" The heads are a fat cylinder of dense metal, perhaps steel, with decorative designs etched in. The handles are simple but display the same jade circle on the end that we see on the other weapons.",
        "",
        "SHIELDS",
        "Of all Sul-Xan armaments, I appreciate their shields the most. Unlike the ovoid appearance of many other cultures, these are more angular. Notches on each side offer resting places for weapons to stab without dropping protection. And impressive jade work upon the surface demonstrates a greater eye for artistry than expected from these savages.",
        "",
        "SHOULDERS",
        "Taking inspiration from the maws of beasts found within the swamps, Sul-Xan shoulder armor focuses on deadly spikes. Large steel thorns jutting from the armor not only make them appear larger but also gives them an edge in case of close quarters grappling. One such spike entered the skull of a guardsman, thus demonstrating their efficacy firsthand.",
        "",
        "STAVES",
        "Despite their primary use by magic-slingers, large spikes upon the staves offer additional benefits in case of melee. The heads are decorated with the same awful visage as the masks. Perhaps representing a revered ancestor of a sort? I will need to find a living subject to interview.",
        "",
        "SWORDS",
        "As with most other Sul-Xan arms, simple yet deadly is the guiding principle for swords. The blades are thick steel, with a slight curve to encourage tearing of flesh. The pommels are made of darkened wood and wrapped in alit leather, with the signature jade ring on the base.",
        "",
        "<title>Crafting Motif 103: Black Fin Legion Style</title>",
        "By Keshu the Black Fin",
        "",
        "Many outsiders assume the Black Fin Legion is an army of Argonians whose purpose is to protect Argonians. They are mistaken. We serve all people who wish to live in peace, Man or Saxhleel. It is my belief that we can best defend our new home in Gideon by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our neighbors, not by fighting to protect only our own. People of all races are welcome in the Black Fin Legion\u2014a stout arm and a willing heart are all I ask.",
        "",
        "The first enemy that an army in the borderlands of the Black Marsh must face is the climate itself. Here, iron and steel rust without special oils, bowstrings rot, and weapon hafts made from northern woods begin to warp. From head to toe, the Black Fin legionnaire must dress for conditions that destroy the arms and armor of other lands. But if the swamp is an enemy to the unprepared, it can also be a potent ally for the warrior who learns its ways.",
        "",
        "Green, of course, must be the primary color of the Black Fin Legion. In the forests and swamps surrounding Gideon, the value of camouflage cannot be overlooked. Highlights of brass and gold may seem out of place, but they too have a purpose. They mimic the glint of sunlight on water.",
        "",
        "AXES",
        "Axes are both weapons and tools in the Black Marsh. The Black Fin legionnaire never knows when they must clear a path through a thicket or fell trees to make a raft. For this reason, our axes are single-bitted weapons with a hammer-like flat opposite the blade. The haft is made from brass or bronze. It may not be as strong as steel, but it resists rust.",
        "",
        "BELTS",
        "The Black Fin legionnaire's belt features a brass buckle and supports a segmented fauld to protect the groin area. In medium or light armors, the fauld segments are made of boiled leather, treated to resist rot in the humid conditions around Gideon.",
        "",
        "BOOTS",
        "Our legionnaires often contend with bogs, thickets, and quicksand. Overly ornate or heavy footwear presents a risk of becoming mired or tangled at every step, so the Black Fin Legion boots are designed to be simple and unornamented.",
        "",
        "BOWS",
        "One of the more common trees of the Black Marsh, the banyan is generally too soft and spongy to be useful in a bow. However, wood from a banyan's root is tough and durable, and does not warp or swell in high humidity. The Black Fin Legion bow is not the most powerful weapon, but it can survive the climate, and long-distance archery is rarely possible in our densely forested landscapes.",
        "",
        "CHESTS",
        "The most effective camouflage replaces straight lines and unnatural shapes with the sort of ragged, broken outlines that are all around us in nature. The Black Fin Legion's breastplates and cuirasses feature tattered overlays of green cloth in leaf- and moss-like shapes, helping the soldier remain hidden in the thickets of the swamp.",
        "",
        "DAGGERS",
        "Designed for thrusting through mail links rather than slashing or cutting, the Black Fin Legion dagger features a strong point with a narrow cross-section. To resist the ever-present threat of rust, it is typically kept well-oiled with grease made from frog fat.",
        "",
        "GLOVES",
        "Rounded and devoid of the sort of jutting spikes or ridges other warriors often wear, the Black Fin Legion gauntlet is smooth to avoid snagging in brush and vines.",
        "",
        "HELMETS",
        "Making sure you see your enemy before he sees you is the first rule of survival in the Black Marsh. We favor an open-faced helm for maximum visibility, then camouflage it with tattered cloth overlays mimicking leaves and mosses.",
        "",
        "LEG GREAVES",
        "Given the sort of terrain the Black Fin Legion must march through, leg armor is kept as light as possible. Medium and light armors dispense with it almost entirely, and even heavy armor uses a closely form-fitted greave that burdens the wearer less than similar armor in other lands.",
        "",
        "MACES",
        "The more warlike Argonian tribes favor tsojeis, cudgels\u00a0 made from Black Marsh hardwoods, but these simple weapons fare poorly against mail and plate. The Black Fin Legion's answer is a double-headed lead hammer with a sturdy brass haft. Highly resistant to rust, the soft but heavy metal offers plenty of striking power.",
        "",
        "SHIELDS",
        "The Black Fin Legion shield is built to a special heater pattern and made of light steel. A cover of oiled leather cut into a leaf-like design helps the wearer to remain concealed in dense foliage, and protects the steel from the ever-present threat of rust in the wet environs of Black Marsh and Blackwood.",
        "",
        "SHOULDERS",
        "A rounded pauldron of steel or tough boiled leather protects the legionnaire's shoulder. Like the rest of the Black Fin legionnaire's armor, the shoulder piece is enameled or dyed in dark green. Heavier armor features a tattered cloth overlay to simulate moss and leaves.",
        "",
        "STAVES",
        "The dense ground cover and frequent downpours of the Black Marsh ensure that many skirmishes take place at very short range. Every Black Fin legionnaire\u2014archer, footsoldier, or spellcaster\u2014must be ready for close combat. For that reason, Black Fin Legion staves feature lead striking heads and sturdy brass hafts for those times when spellcasters find themselves in melee.",
        "",
        "SWORDS",
        "The difficulty of maintaining steel blades in the conditions around Gideon are not to be ignored; swords are not very common among Black Fin legionnaires. The typical legion sword is a sturdy blade designed for both slashing and thrusting, with a simple crossguard that is not likely to be snagged in hanging vines.",

        "Mad! Mad, they call me! These flat-headed smiths with their smoldering forges no larger than tea kettles. Should we not heed the challenge of Boethiah? Should we cower in the face of the Testing Gods? These sour-hearted cowards may be content to hammer out nails and nixshoes, but not I. I look to grander things. Distant realms! Mighty tools! Designs that exceed mortal handiwork in every conceivable respect! Compared to Daedric craft, even the keenest Nirn-blade is no sharper than a butter knife. The sturdiest Dunmeri shield affords less protection than a sheet of Daedric parchment. I will pry these secrets from the blazing corner of the House of Troubles by sweat and blood.",
        "",
        "This journal shall serve as a fulsome account of what I find wandering the Destroyer-God's realm. With these designs committed to the page, I shall return to Morrowind not as a simple smith, but as a master of the Daedric forge!",
        "",
        "AXES",
        "Dremora favor heavy axes with keen, crescent edges. No great surprise, given their predilection for using weighty materials. The two-handed version features a broad double-head that can hew stone without losing its sharpness. Their hand axes are no less deadly\u2014trading the second head for a pair of dagger-like prongs.",
        "",
        "BELTS",
        "I acquired a Daedric belt and even now, weeks on, I cannot identify the source of the leather. Many hulking beasts wander the Deadlands. Any one of them could have supplied the hide. If I were forced to compare it to something on Nirn, I'd compare it to an elder alit\u2014one scarred and battered by years in the ash. The buckle features sharp edges and spikes, making cinching a dangerous task. But once secured, nothing short of a Daedroth's bite could break this belt's hold.",
        "",
        "BOOTS",
        "A Dremora's boots\u2014even those worn by scholars and spies\u2014feature heavy, sharpened toes and serrated polyenes. This allows the warrior to strike from unexpected angles, well-beneath their adversary's sight-line. When battling a kynreeve clad in this armor, a swift kick or knee-lunge can prove fatal.",
        "",
        "BOWS",
        "Daedric bows are unique in that they seem effective in both ranged and melee combat. Both of the bow's limbs feature sharp metal cladding that can deflect enemy arrows and inflict grievous wounds to any who stray too close.",
        "",
        "CHESTS",
        "The cuirasses and gambesons I've observed here in the Deadlands all share one vital feature: sharpness. The Daedric smiths create ornate interlocking and overlaying metallic patterns that accentuate the brutal edges of the plates. This allows for a startling degree of flexibility without sacrificing protection. Leather of mysterious origin serves as the foundation for the piece, shielding more exposed regions from lighter blows.",
        "",
        "DAGGERS",
        "Daedric daggers resemble the Destroyer's Razor in several respects. The leaf-shaped blade and fang-like cross guard give it a threatening silhouette. Beneath the handle, a clawed pommel affords the wielder the opportunity to strike from unexpected angles. The perfect weapon for a quiet ash-hunter.",
        "",
        "GLOVES",
        "Much like their boots, the Dremora's gloves feature clawed tips. This allows for brutal scratches if no weapon is near to hand. Even light gauntlets provide ample protection at the wrists; spiked, interlocking bracers keep the forearms protected while also adding heft to blows.",
        "",
        "HELMETS",
        "All Daedric helms and hoods provide total cover to the wearer's face. This grants both protection and anonymity\u2014vital features for Dremora assassins.

        "",
        "LEG GREAVES",
        "Daedric greaves and breeches are rugged and heavy\u2014a far cry from the bare legs our warriors seem to favor. While the lighter armor relies on layers of thick leather for protection, the heavier panoply protects the thighs with wide metal plates. Multiple layers of sharpened metal allow for greater flexibility on the battlefield.",
        "",
        "MACES",
        "Daedric warriors utilize a brutal crossbreed of a maul and a warhammer. The weighted heads of the weapon feature broad prongs that can puncture the thickest cuirasses. Even light blows from this bludgeon can crush a skull as easily as a kwama egg.",

In the realm of the Destroyer, even that which affords protection can kill.",
        "",
        "SHOULDERS",
        "Daedric smiths sharpen all their pauldrons and arm cops to a razor's edge. While simple intimidation might be the chief reason for this technique, the prongs also excel at breaking weapons and warding off foolish grapplers.",

        "STAVES",
        "Unsurprisingly, Daedric staves are wrought from metal, not wood. Like many of their other weapons, they feature a clawed bottom for gouging. But the true marvel is the headpiece. These imposing caps distill the Daedric aesthetic to its most basic and brutal elements\u2014broad, interlocking spikes that fan out like the splayed claws of a beast.",
        "",
        "SWORDS",

        "Though notes about the styles of the leading Elven societies of current-day Tamriel have already been compiled, there is more to say, as the mer, who revere their ancestors and ancestry, have a special regard for the history of Aldmeri culture. The Merethic Era, when Elves first conquered and colonized Tamriel, they regard as a golden age to be emulated. As a result the clothing and armor of that period never really goes out of style, and many Elves still affect the styles and manners of the ancient Aldmeri. It is not at all unusual, even on continental Tamriel, to encounter a High Elf or Dark Elf dressed like an ancient Ayleid or Chimer. The Elves call this practice \"draping Ehlnofic,\" but the rest of us just call it \"Ancient Elven\" and leave it at that.",

But the Bosmer, like we Argonians, seem to prefer to live in the Aurbic Now, showing relatively little regard for the ways of former ages.)",
        "Ancient Elven is different from Elven styles favored by modern artisans of Summerset and Morrowind in that it is somewhat more organic, and yet at the same time more abstract. Flowing floral motifs are common, usually tapering to a sharp point or end, as in the sharp-peaked arches so familiar to the inhabitants of Cyrodiil from our ubiquitous Ayleid ruins. Circles, semi-circles, and arcs abound, often containing the organic tapering tendrils, much as the Aedra (whom the Elves claim as ancestors) were constrained by the creation of the Mundus.",

Probably the most familiar to us Cyrodilics are the savage clans of the Reachmen, who dwell in the wild mountains between Skyrim and High Rock, and whose raiders have been seen on the outskirts of Bruma within living memory. But there are also the Ashlanders of Morrowind, the fierce Kothringi of Black Marsh, the Ket Keptu of central Hammerfell, and many others.",

Why this should be is fodder for another ethnographic study more speculative than this one, which is merely descriptive. (Therefore, on to the description.)",

The so-called barbaric tribes simply disdain all ideas of tasteful restraint, preferring the lurid and bizarre. Bright colors are favored, and materials may be lacquered to almost any hue. Typical accouterments include skulls, antlers, feathers, strings of teeth, accents of beaten copper, and weapons ostentatious in size and number.",

Each item that warchief is wearing was carefully selected for its proven utility, and represents a decision backed by millennia of tradition. This is a style of arms and armor we ethnographers call the \"Primal,\" and it is as distinctive and recognizable as any other culture set.",
        "Goblins and other folk who have adopted the Primal style are typically superb scavengers and looters. They seem to have a special sense for where to find the sort of cast-off yet serviceable, even exceptional equipment that will fit the Primal esthetic. And they are as proud of their turn-out as any Imperial centurion.",
        "Recent scholarship by Doctor Intricatus of Gwylim University confirms this, and adds some new information that shows that \"primal\" is, indeed, the optimal label for this style. His study of the fifty-seven Primal ensembles worn by the massacred Knife-Biter Goblin tribe showed that many of the items found on the corpses were hundreds, if not thousands of years old. Some of the greaves and cuirasses appeared to date from the early First Era, and represented ancient forging techniques that have since been lost to history. Did the Goblins loot these from ancient Cyrodilic ruins, as they've been known to do? Or did they actually pass them down, generation by generation, since time immemorial?",

And as I can now hear the Professor's voice whispering in my ear almost constantly, it is time to conclude these notes and move on to telling the story of his travels through the doors of Oblivion.",
        "The Daedra, as the Professor has so often remarked, are creatures of chaos, entities of great energy and force but entirely lacking in originality. They can imitate, they can exaggerate, and they can corrupt, but they cannot create anything new. That is a capability inherent only in the Aedra, and in we mortals of Nirn, to whom they gave it as a gift.

They may to our eyes be ornamented with outlandish spikes and melodramatic flourishes, but look inside a suit of Daedric armor and you'll find the familiar padding and straps that enable it to be worn by anyone of conventional shape. Pick up a Daedric sword, and despite its bizarre shape you will find the grip comfortable, the heft well-balanced. Indeed, it is said that the famous Artifacts of the Daedric Princes, such as the Mace of Molag Bal, were mostly made by mortal artisans who were enticed or forced to create them.",

Some of these cultures still wallow in barbarism, such as the clans of the Reachmen, famous\u2014or rather infamous\u2014for their savage raids over the northern borders. But I also came across the clothing of a culture previously unknown to me, that of the Skaal, who inhabit an island in the Sea of Ghosts named Solstheim (I hope I've spelled that right\u2014my notes were taken in haste).",
        "Unlike the Reachmen, racially the Skaal are Nords, but they differ from their continental cousins, who were among the first foreigners to adopt the worship of the Eight Divines, in that the Skaal still cling to a primitive monotheism, venerating a single creator they call \"the All-Maker.\" At least some of the shamans of this ancient faith specialize in Frost Magic, and are called \"Frostcasters.\" (All this is according to the information inscribed on a tablet next to the clothing display.)",
        "The most curious aspect of this Frostcaster clothing was its extensive use of an unfamiliar translucent blue-white material labeled \"Stalhrim,\" a sort of crystalline metal unlike anything I've ever seen. It was so strange that, after checking to make sure no one was paying any attention to what I was doing, I laid hands upon it, rubbing and tapping. It was rigid, faceted yet smooth, and gave off a distinct chill, despite the heat from the Embassy's roaring log fires. I was fascinated, and went so far as to try to scratch this Stahlrim [sic] with a nail file from my clutch\u2014to no effect whatsoever.

The details are described below.",

        "While it is an overstatement of the ignorant to characterize we Khajiit as flighty and superficial, it is true that not all of us, like this one, have the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as something shallow and recent. This is particularly false as regards the seven kingdoms that became the Federation of Pellitine, a land with a history long and deep. This Servant of the Mane hopes, in the few lines that follow, to cast some light our Southern Elsweyr military traditions.",
        "<header>AXES</header>",
        "Unlike the crude axes of northern barbarians, Pellitine cleavers combine style and martial efficacy, making each weapon a work of art. The sumptuous curve of the axe head, accented by sleek, fang-like prongs allow the attacker to both cleave and stab with every swing.",
        "<header>BELTS</header>",
        "In Pellitine, fit is of paramount importance. Metal buckles can only approximate the wearer's girth, resulting in a slouching and unsightly waistline fit only for a city vagrant or a cane-farmer. Our braided leather belts guarantee a perfect cinch every time.",
        "<header>BOOTS</header>",
        "A Khajiit's graceful feet should never suffer the indignity of a close-toed boot. Without the freedom to flex and retract, our claws grow dull and useless. And dull-clawed Khajiit can hardly call themselves children of Alkosh! Alas, the boots' leather padding still covers the shapely calves and ankles, but complex lacing helps the leg retain a pleasing shape.",
        "<header>BOWS</header>",
        "Since time out of memory, man, mer, and beast have all suffered death and defeat at the point of Pellitine arrows. The Wood Elves fancy themselves Tamriel's greatest marksmen, but their wooden pauper-bows cannot match the range or precision of their Khajiiti counterparts. A flexible metal frame, senche-gut bow-strings, and peerless styling make the Pellitine bow the envy of archers everywhere.",
        "<header>CHEST PIECES</header>",
        "Torval's damp climate and our distaste for restrictive clothing make metal armor very unpopular here in Southern Elsweyr. Leave heavy iron hauberks to the hoary Nords and flat-footed Bretons, yes? A Pellitine cuirass, by contrast, is typically made of durable boiled leather, shaped, stamped, and tailored to fit the wearer's torso like a glove.",
        "<header>DAGGERS</header>",
        "No shape is more distinctive to the Khajiiti people than the curve. The rounded crescents of Jone and Jode and the natural flexure of our fangs and claws are both given voice in the Pellitine dagger. The whorled guard and roaring pommel likewise reflect the frightful mysteries of Khajiiti culture!",
        "<header>GLOVES</header>",
        "A Khajiiti glove must do two things well: protect the forearms, and leave the fingers bare. Pellitine gloves boast perfection on both counts. The stylish leather vambraces deflect all but the strongest blows. But more importantly, these gloves leave the claws completely unrestricted, allowing the wearer to slash and stab to their heart's content.",
        "<header>HELMETS</header>",
        "There is no greater weapon on the battlefield than fear. When an enemy's eyes widen and their jaw falls slack with terror, the contest is already decided. To that end, Pellitine helmets all bear the terrifying aspect of a snarling cat-demon.",
        "<header>LEG GREAVES</header>",
        "As Khibazi the Whirlwind once said, \"All fights begin at the thighs.\" Tailored silken pants provide ample flexibility and protection at the knees, while molded leather greaves protect the upper-legs. Like all elements of the Pellitine panoply, these greaves feature ornate crescents and swirling contours that complement the wearer's inherent grace.",
        "<header>MACES</header>",
        "The defining features of foreign maces are their simplicity and tremendous weight. No surprise, then, that Pellitine maces are both light and beautiful. Their lacquered wooden construction and hooked shape allow for swift and brutal strikes that put the crude, loping swings of barbarian maulers to shame.",
        "<header>SHIELDS</header>",
        "Northern barbarians are often surprised by the comparative lightness of the Pellitine aegis. Rather than try to lift a heavy iron heater shield, Khajiiti warriors of Southern Elsweyr rely on hardened leather affixed to a sturdy bronze frame\u2014an arrangement that provides maneuverability and protection in equal measure.",
        "<header>SHOULDER ARMOR</header>",
        "Nothing enhances a warrior's imposing silhouette quite like a set of sturdy pauldrons. These protective shoulder-coverings feature subtle curves and sharpened leather prongs that are impossible to miss.",
        "<header>STAVES</header>",
        "When it comes to martial refinement, the Pellitine staff is a weapon without peer. While the haft is almost always fashioned out of stout Tenmar oak, the headpiece is a bronzesmith's masterpiece. Fragile lotus blossoms and grand chandeliers rest atop the staff like a king's crown, making even the most boorish wielder look like royalty.",
        "<header>SWORDS</header>",
        "Much like the Pellitine dagger, the swords of Southern Elsweyr evince the regal and deadly nature of the Khajiiti people. The grand, curved blade often features ornate, swirling designs that complement the guard's rounded contours. In skilled hands, this weapon can kill practically anything, from the clumsiest Goblin to the most fearsome dro-m'Athra.",

But to truly honor Alkosh, we must adorn ourselves with a fitting panoply\u2014armor and weapons that give voice to both Khajiit and Dragon! Therefore, the smith-adepts of Sunspire have created this collection of arms and armor. Each piece bears the First Cat's blessing.",
        "<header>AXES</header>",
        "Our mighty axes honor Alkosh, yes, but Jone and Jode also. Smith-adepts affix weighted disks to the axe heads to add great heft to every swing.

        "<header>BELTS</header>",
        "Any avowed Khajiit, from highest curate to lowliest novitiate, can tell you that prayer begins at the belly. We do not mutter our mantras to blessed Alkosh with our mouths alone. No! We summon them up from the stomach. No surprise then that we protect our stomachs with woven cloth and metals of the highest quality.",
        "<header>BOOTS</header>",
        "While many Khajiit insist that all footwear should leave the toes bare, there is something to be said for a snug leather sole\u2014particularly when wandering the frigid peaks and searing depths of Sunspire. Whether boot, shoe, or sandal, our footwear provides ample protection from the elements and the foes of blessed Alkosh.",
        "<header>BOWS</header>",
        "The bowyers of Sunspire are right to boast when demonstrating the strength of their arms. Wood cured in the sacred heat of the Shrine of Jode flexes like a young Dagi, but launches arrows that strike with a Senche-raht's strength!",
        "<header>CHEST PIECES</header>",
        "Our Dragon-father, Alkosh, made us strong, while our mother, Azurah, made us lithe and swift. The snug tunics and sturdy breastplates of Sunspire reflect the will of both! No true Khajiit would suffer inside a stuffy metal shell. So, even our heaviest hauberks leave room to flex and bend.",
        "<header>DAGGERS</header>",
        "Of all the weapons our smith-adepts forge, the daggers are the most distinctive. Some say they resemble the fangs of mighty Alkosh; others say that their crescent blades match the curves of Jone and Jode. Both are true, I think. In the hands of a pious warrior, these twin blades are deadly indeed!",
        "<header>GLOVES</header>",
        "Our boots may shield our toes from the elements, but even the most pious Khajiit with the most cautious heart cannot keep all their claws restrained. Sunspire gloves are little more than masterfully crafted bracers; they protect the wrists, but leave our birth-weapons free to slash and rend the enemies of Alkosh!",
        "<header>HELMETS</header>",
        "A child of the Dragon King of Cats must be more than a simple Khajiit. They must find their truest heart, where the Dragon within resides. Our helmets' design serves as a constant reminder of our true nature. We are both cat and Dragon. The cat's silhouette crowned by the snarling aspect of blessed Alkosh makes that truth manifest!",
        "<header>LEG GREAVES</header>",

        "<header>MACES</header>",
        "A Sunspire mace features a perfect, striated sphere at the striking end that mimics the forms of Jone and Jode. Like Alkosh himself, these weapons strike with perfect force\u2014leaving flesh intact while pulverizing the bone and sinew beneath.",
        "<header>SHIELDS</header>",

Smith-adepts affix multiple plates to a central aegis, then lace it with prayer cords to create a sturdy, but visually pleasing work of art!",
        "<header>SHOULDERS</header>",
        "All Sunspire shoulder armor, from the simplest epaulets to the strongest pauldrons, honor Alkosh with prayerful motifs and woven prayer cords. Our arms may not bear the sublime weight of a Dragon's wings, but we must protect them nonetheless!",
        "<header>STAVES</header>",
        "Ah, old age! It is a curse, it's true. In the days before Alkosh's return, I often leaned on cedarwood walking sticks and the like. Now, though? Now I steady myself on one of our mighty staves\u2014proud weapons that bear the phases of Jone and Jode emblazoned on precious metal disks. Great power swirls within their headpieces. With Alkosh's blessing, we shall use that power to lead the Khajiit to enlightenment!",

Then Sidura spent some time updating and repairing them, with the help of some skilled volunteers. They turned out nicely, yes? Old Dragonguard mixed with new! Dashing and functional!",
        "<header>AXES</header>",
        "Sidura is not one for axes, but if she had to choose? She'd pick the Dragonguard axes. Well-balanced, with ornamental touches picking up on the Dragonguard symbol.

        "<header>BELTS</header>",
        "Oh, the detail on the waist gear! Graceful and airy, to Sidura's mind. Protective, too, especially for those midriff swipes. Dragon claw attacks are serious, yes, and better the claw catches on this armor than inside your gut.",
        "<header>BOOTS</header>",
        "Old Dragonguard used a range of light and heavy materials to protect their feet. Sidura made sure to keep those sensibilities intact while enhancing the decorative elements. Don't worry about ankle slices with this footwear\u2014we added extra protection there due to cultists.",

        "Whether you use one or two daggers when fighting, the Dragonguard dagger allows you to easily catch a foe's weapons or turn away a claw thanks to the quillon's design. Sidura has tested these daggers herself and finds them to be her favorite of all daggers!",

        "Use flexible gloves for nimble fighting or choose metal gauntlets to help stop blows from landing! We restored the hand armor we found with an eye toward ensuring you could continue to grasp your weapon while dealing with Dragon shouts. Sidura thinks the old Dragonguard would approve.",

        "The Dragonguard knew that you had to be nimble while fighting Dragons, so their leg armor takes that into account. You might not like tucking and rolling to avoid a Dragon's attack, but you won't die because your greaves prevent it! Sidura approves!",
        "<header>MACES</header>",
        "Sidura recommends you handle the maces with care. The flanges on the two-handed versions are large, but even the one-handed flanges can bite.

        "Sidura is not a staff fighter, but this staff tempts her. It looks impressive. This one loves the red gems they used. Draws the eye, yes? Just do not sleep with this staff next to you if you have a mane. The ornate head on this staff tangles badly with longer hair.",

The Green's warriors search the boughs, plucking vices from their hiding places and devouring them with relish. Transgression and consequence. Wickedness and payment in kind. We Stags exact that punishment. We claim that payment in blood. Z'en, god of toil and vengeance, demands nothing less.",
