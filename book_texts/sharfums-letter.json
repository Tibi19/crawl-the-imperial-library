        "You will blame Sneg, but you should not. I made this decision on my own. If you must know the reason it is that for a long time I was ashamed of being an Orc. While other peoples grow strong and proud with their great cities--Shornhelm, Stormhaven, Daggerall, Mournhold, Evermore--we Orcs languish without a home. In Orsinium, I no longer need to be ashamed.",
