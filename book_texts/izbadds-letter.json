I can be found at the Anchor's Point Inn in Evermore most times. I suspect, from observations of others who pass along useful information, that you two may be working with others. If that is the case, I may be interested in speaking with them as well.",

Maybe you should visit this merchant. Jhaka and I may head that way as well, in case this is some sort of trap. I've no qualms about dealing with anyone who means us harm."
