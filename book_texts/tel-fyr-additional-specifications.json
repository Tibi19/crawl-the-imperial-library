        "While there is no doubt that we have delivered a tower of exquisite design, the council wants Tel Fyr to exceed all expectations of its namesake. In that regard, the new owner has outlined some changes to better suit his needs. This includes expanding the subterranean footprint into the natural caverns abutting the foundation. This vast area will require months of additional shaping, to which you are all obligated to complete for the honor of our house. Continue to work with the diligence you have shown thus far and you can claim your efforts contributed to one of the finest endeavors undertaken by your discipline."
