        "Entry 7\nSeveral things have now tried to gnaw my legs off. I was wrong. This is a horrible place. Strange and terrible. I must have slipped a gear, thinking I could handle this on my own.",
        "Entry 8\nAfter I brought down what seemed like the hundredth dire wolf, I ate its leg. Without scrib jelly even. It was either that or starve. If I get out of this place, Adjunct Daro is going to get a piece of my mind!",
        "Entry 9\nI'm starting to get the impression this is another plane of existence. Some dark corner of Oblivion maybe. There certainly are plenty of shadows here."
