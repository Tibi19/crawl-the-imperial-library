        "They call themselves the Berne Clan, the bastards! They got my brother, but they didn't get me. I've been watching from the shadows as these fiends feast. Some of these horrors are nothing more than beasts, devouring the life-blood of everyone they find.",

They gestured at a mechanical spider and the creature came to life, but it didn't always work as intended. Sometimes a controlled spider wanders off on its own, other times it attacks. I think they're trying to get it to unlock a component cache in the manufactory.",
