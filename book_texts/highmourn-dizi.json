        "A flute of Akavari design, this instrument was played at the funerary procession for the last Akaviri Potentate, Savirien-Chorak.",
        "It is said that as the sad and haunting notes of the dizi were played, the Akaviri faithful in attendance broke into tears, hearing the distant voice of their homeland. Even non-Akaviri were moved by the mournful, yearning tones, some even more than the Akaviri themselves."
