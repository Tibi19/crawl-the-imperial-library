        "Hello, my friend, come take a seat,\ngrab something sweet, and join us for some fun.\nThe tickle felt in this one's ear\nas you drew near says you've got a tidy sum.\nThe clink of coins from your jaunty loins\nSing of riches to be won.\nLet down your mane, join in our game.\nWe've only just begun!",
        "Chorus:\nPlace your wager, raise the stakes\nBuild a tower from your drakes.\nDraw your fortune, toss your wealth\nRisk it all, you'll have your health.\nAnd if you wind up on the street\nAt least you lived like true Khajiit.",
        "I see, my friend, that you have pluck\nbut you're short on luck\u2014that hand was hard to beat.\nAnd if you find you're feeling cross\nabout this tragic loss, there's a cause for your defeat.",
        "You took your chance on a furtive glance\nAt cards that couldn't compete.\nBut this cat's eyes, they tell no lies\nNext time be more discreet.",
        "Chorus:\nTake a gamble, oops you're done.\nNow you're broke, tuck tail and run!\nDon't make a scene or swear and roar.\nTossed out, to hoots and howls galore\nNext time your money's on deceit\nHave the good sense to try and cheat."
