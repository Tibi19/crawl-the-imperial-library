        "Your burdensome assistant keeper has repeatedly hounded my rangers for opportunities to assist with their duties and applied for yet another transfer to ranger detail. I suggest you keep Elise too busy with her current duties to find opportunities to pester her betters. How you handle your staff is your own affair, but when it begins to affect our work, I take issue. And kindly inform Elise that rangers excel at silence, so she can begin her training there.",
