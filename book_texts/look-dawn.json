        "I came here to investigate. I am going to find answers, or I will die trying.",
        "I wrote this in case I don't make it back. If you're reading this, whatever is haunting this tomb has probably killed me. You should go before it kills you, too.",
        "I say this so you can make your peace with Azura before it happens to you. Turn back now. Look to the dawn. See her radiant majesty. It's not too late to save your life, and more importantly, your soul.",
        "Darkness is all around you. Turn back to the dawn."
