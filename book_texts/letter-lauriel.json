        "I wish you would respond to my letters. I've learned so much here, but I miss my sister. I miss our late-night debates and silly games. Please, just let me know how you're doing. It doesn't have to be more than a few sentences\u2014just something to let me know you're all right.",
        "Mother says you spend whole days in your room, and she rarely hears you sing anymore. It breaks my heart to think that I might have driven you to this wretched state. I should be done with my studies in another year or two. I promise you, when I return home I'll return for good.",
        "Please, write me back.",
        "Your loving sister,\nSelenwe"
