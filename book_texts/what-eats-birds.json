        "Blasted birds. Never a moment's peace. Everywhere I look, birds! Great gulls with smiling beaks. Tiny things with blue feathers, nipping at flies. Never silent. No, never quiet.",
        "What eats birds? Cats, but they're no better than birds. Always grooming themselves. Tiny fiends with tiny claws. Always stealing my fish!",
        "Where will I go? This island is covered in cats. Cat men! Men who are cats. Think they can fool me? They're in it with the birds!",
        "Better to go into the wilderness. Find someplace safe. Maybe underground. No cats there, no birds! Only the dark. Dark and cold, like a fish."
