        "(Dunmer Traditional Ballad)",
        "Did you come to hide from war,\nOr come to herd the guar,\nOr were you with the House Guard\nAt the Battle of Molag Beran?\nFor I was there, and fought and cried,\nAnd tasted blood and thunder.\nI stood in line with mace and shield\nAs Dunmer clan slew Dunmer.",
        "The guard of House Retheran\nWere bright arrayed for battle.\nThey came in pride, in columns wide,\nBut ran like frightened cattle.\nWe stood our ground on Tadras Banks,\nThen turned their flanks and roweled them.\nThe field was bright with cousin's blood\nSpilled by doughty Drenim.",
        "We lost some gallant gentlemen\nFrom ranks of brave House Drenim.\nAnd many a wand'ring widow weeps\nOn the hills of Molag Beran.\nSome fell for wrong, some fell for right,\nAll for the colors wearin',\nAnd many bade the world good-night\nAt the Battle of Molag Beran."
