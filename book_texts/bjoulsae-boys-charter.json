        "The Bjoulsae Boys are selflessly dedicated to helping the hard-working impoverished people of the Evermore region. For too long have the king and his nobles lived in luxury while countless others have worked night and day just to survive. Our goal, quite simply, is to spread the wealth. We will rob and steal from the crown and any members of Evemore's upper classes. The spoils of our labor will be quietly left in sewers, on doorsteps, and at the sides of sleeping beggars. We shall achieve equality in Evermore!\n\u2014 Curnard \"The Generous\" Thelin"
