        "I know its name!\nI have seen signs of a spectral abomination lurking in these caves.\nI have survived long enough to know it is not a creature of flesh.\nIt is bone, yet it feeds on blood.\nI dare not return to the surface before I know the truth.\nI dare not speak above a whisper, lest it hear me.\nMy footfalls would summon it.\nRunning would summon it.\nScreaming would summon it.\nSleeping would make me a victim.\nI am not going back until I know the truth \u2026 or until it feasts on my blood.\nIt will not! I will prevail!\nI will stay awake.\nI must not sleep.\nI know its name, and I will destroy it."
