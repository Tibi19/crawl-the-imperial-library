        "12th of Frostfall\nThe prison has been on high alert for days and the prisoners are on edge. They keep asking me what's going on but I don't even know myself. The commander is supposed to give us a briefing soon.",
        "18th of Frostfall\nIt's official \u2026 we're being recalled and have been instructed to take everything of value with us. The commander told us not to bother much with the prisoners, as they wouldn't be able to leave even if they wanted to. I heard a rumor he performed a ritual to seal them in here forever. Seems an unnecessarily cruel fate, even for criminals.",
        "20th of Frostfall\nI was ordered to load all the supplies for the quartermaster but I couldn't bring myself to leave the inmates with nothing. I've managed to hide some food and equipment around the prison and I intend to give this book to General Raetus when I leave so he can find it. He was my commanding officer before he was court-martialed and he always treated me with respect. It's the least I can do."
