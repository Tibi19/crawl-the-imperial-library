        "At the Queen's behest, I have agreed to perform an important part of the ritual honoring the Ancestral Spirits. Since many of the ancestors have grown hostile, I plan to do this in a quiet grove where I often meditate. The area is usually only occupied by a lone spirit named Colonwe. While mischievous and enigmatic, Colonwe knows me and has always tolerated my presence in the past. I feel certain it will be a safe place to perform the ritual ceremony.",
