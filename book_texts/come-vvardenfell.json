        "I know you've got a place above that store in Stormwind, but you really have to join me in Vvardenfell. I've been here less than a year and I've already got my own place just outside Balmora. I'm making enough gold that I take voyages down to Vivec City every month or so.",
        "You wouldn't believe the architecture here. They built \"the City of the Warrior-Poet\" right out on the water. All these multi-layered cantons\u2014I have a hard time finding my way around!",
        "And Balmora has a canal running right through the center of the town. I though they'd call it the \"town of waters,\" but it really should be \"the town of beautiful barmaids.\" There's a Dark Elf woman working at one of the inns who really likes me, I can tell.",
        "Anyway, when you get here, find me in Balmora. It's north of Seyda Neen. If you land in Vivec City, spend the extra gold for a barge trip. The wildlife along the road can be a bit dangerous.",
