        "I shall need the following if my scheme is to succeed:\n1. A detailed Ayleid Grimoire addressing transliminal matters and issues of cross-planar conjunction\u2014look for titles featuring words such as Alasilagea (vision-lore), Ceyemeratu (shadow-music), Goriarcan (secret-magic), Heculmora (outcast-Daedra), and Silatarn (shining-portal). There must be one or two books in this Librarium that will serve.\n2. Laboratorical Equipment such as Alembics, Cauldrons, Vials, et cetera. Can't have too many.\n3. A Focal Brazier large and potent enough to anchor the Thaumaturgical Fetters.\nThen I'll just need to conjure some common Dremora Churls to do the menial work. I can use the Codicil of Longueur to keep them on this plane indefinitely\u2014if I can just remember where I put that scroll."
