        "[[The book is written in Daedric, but the illustrations of various  complex wheel, gear, and pulley arrangements suggest that this could be  the Book of the Wheels of Heaven. By studying the tables of codes in the  back, you discover that the code you are looking for is Doht Yoodt Seht  Koht, or DUSK in Tamrielic. The table also displays the codes written  as numerals, which happily are the same in Tamrielic and Daedric --  4-21-19-11 -- which corresponds to the number of the letters in the  alphabet sequence.]]"
