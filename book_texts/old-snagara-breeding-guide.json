        "You don't do much. Just make sure she stays in the cage. Every few days, another comes out. I don't know how the bull gets here, but he's very sneaky. One of the healers said that some animals impregnate themselves sometimes. But that sounds really stupid.",
        "Safety tips:\n1. Don't open the cage to brush her or groom her. She will bite you.\n2. When the baby comes, ask for help. You'll need at least a dozen hands to hold her still while you take it.\n3. Cage the baby quickly. They will run away.",
        "Most important, whatever you do, don't slaughter a baby near her. The first caretaker did that, and now he's buried nearby with half of her crest buried in his gut.",
        "Stay safe, and good luck. I hope I'm rich, fat, and retired by the time you read this."
