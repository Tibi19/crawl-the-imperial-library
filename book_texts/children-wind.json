        "Rising from your lively breeze\nA flock of winsome sycamore seeds\nRound and round they waltz and whirl\nOn one wing they dance and twirl",
        "Drifting far from home they sail\nCarried by your lofty gale\nAnd where they finally come to rest\nAnother tree begins to nest",
        "Soon you call a storm to turn the van\nAnd tuck them in with gentle rain\nThen once their shower's done\nBlow them away and free the sun",
        "Once nurtured by your clouds in time\nThese saplings stretch their limbs and climb\nReaching farther through many springs\nUntil they've fully spread their wings",
        "And on your gale their seeds will soar\nOn the journey of White Sycamore"
