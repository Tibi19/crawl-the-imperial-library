        "I cannot wait to see you again. As I promised when last we met, I have found a necklace fit for you. A rather elegant ruby. Red is very much your color, I feel. To cement our bond. I wear the gold pendant you gave me every day, close to my heart. I know you worried that it was, as you said, a simple piece. But I treasure it more than all the other expensive baubles I own.",

        "I meant what I said. The difference in our wealth matters not to me. I see you working hard, traveling, striving! And now you tell me you will be working as an agent for a well-known trading company from the Systres Archipelago? I know that you are a good man. I did not know how much I needed someone like you in my life. Since that fateful day our paths crossed at the temple in Wayrest, I have prayed to the Eight every night. Mara touched me, touched us, that day.",
        "",
        "We have much to talk about and so much to plan for. I am sending this to the inn at Seyda Neen, as you said it was the best way to reach you. I know your pride keeps telling you to keep working, and I understand that. But I think I can, at least, make your working a bit smoother, and perhaps even more profitable. With your new connections and my various business concerns, we will be able to accomplish much together.",
