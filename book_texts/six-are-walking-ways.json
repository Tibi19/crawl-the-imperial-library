        "(A Traditional Song)",
        "Six are the walking ways, enigma, enemy, teachers\nBegat by precursor gods, come we now their creatures\nEmbody splendor in your name, and wisdom in your features",
        "By the sword I mean the night\nBy the word I mean the dead\nBy the sword I mean a sigh\nBy the word I mean the end",
        "Six are the guardians, three fore and three incarnate\nHere to test your hero's ways, and show that you can learn it\nThe truest works we shall behold are those made by the silent",
        "By the sword I mean the night\nBy the word I mean the dead\nBy the sword I mean a sigh\nBy the word I mean the end"
