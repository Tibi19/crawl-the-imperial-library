        "Again I beg you to send guards. Danger surrounds us in these wilds. The workers are frightened of their own shadows out here. They claim the ground is cursed, that the trees move about under cover of darkness and bleed when cut. Whenever a worker runs away at night, the others wake up in the morning convinced that he's been killed, by monsters or the trees.",
        "Send us guards from the City. A few soldiers will reassure the loggers and greatly increase our productivity. I cannot fulfill my quotas with terrified workers who jump at every sound.",
