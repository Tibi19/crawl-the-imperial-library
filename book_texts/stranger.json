        "[These are the words of the prophecy called \"The Stranger.\" I wrote  them down as she spoke them to me.]",
        "When earth is sundered, and skies choked black,\nAnd sleepers serve the seven curses,\nTo the hearth there comes a stranger,\nJourneyed far 'neath moon and star.",
        "Though stark-born to sire uncertain,\nHis aspect marks his certain fate.\nWicked stalk him, righteous curse him.\nProphets speak, but all deny.",
        "Many trials make manifest\nThe stranger's fate, the curses' bane.\nMany touchstones try the stranger.\nMany fall, but one remains."
