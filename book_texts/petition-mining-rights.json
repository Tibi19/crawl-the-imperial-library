        "One Edwin Asquith hereby requests, on behalf of his organization, composed primarily of mercenaries under allegiance to the Daggerfall Covenant, to secure mining rights to the recently-discovered silver lode in the Wrothgarian Mountains.",
        "It is proposed that the silver will be extracted in service to the Covenant and to fund ongoing operations in Cyrodiil, with a twentieth portion of everything extracted to go to King Kurog himself.",
        "[At the end of the request, a different hand has made several notes.]",
        "3 Last Seed: Recommendation: Reject. Why take a twentieth of the silver when entire lode could fund re-building?",
        "15 Last Seed: I thought this was rejected? Reports indicate the mine is currently occupied. It's recommended that soldiers be sent to secure the mine at once."
