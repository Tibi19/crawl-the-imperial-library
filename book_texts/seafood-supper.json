        "Simple recipes my mother jotted down for me, on the occasion of my marriage. This supper serves four.",
        "Mudcrab Cakes",
        "These do not travel well, but one can use leftover mudcrab this way if fresh crab meat is unavailable. You may season these quite liberally, as some find the flavor of mudcrab too earthy for their taste.",
        "Steam mudcrabs enough to obtain a pound of their succulent flesh, taking care to sort out the cartilage and shell.",
        "Add to the meat a half-pound of equal parts of imperial, and barley flour. Add water until the mixture can be formed into a ball. Season liberally with salt and ground peppercorns.",
        "Form the mixture into small pies, pressing together firmly, yet with the gentle touch. Fry them on an oiled griddle until crisp on both sides.",
        "Grilled Battaglir",
        "This dish can be made in advance as it reheats well over low coals. You can also place it at the edge of the fire while making the mudcrab cakes. Just remember to turn it now and then to heat it through on all sides.",
        "Gather a quarter peck of battaglir weeds. After cleaning them of dirt and any small bugs, finely chop the battaglir.",
        "Place large skillet onto the fire, throw in gobbets of beef drippings and melt. Fry the battaglir until the color turns a dark green. Add salt, pepper and garlic to taste.",
        "Serve over day-old bread."
