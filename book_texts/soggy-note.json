        "Well, this is the end. Stuck with a poisoned blade and left to die in a sunken ship. What a way to go. The crabs are already sizing me up. Funny. I always loved eating crabs. Fair's fair, I guess.",
        "I thought I might write a farewell note to everyone I'll miss, but to Oblivion with that! I want those skeeving bastards to pay for what they did to me!",
        "If you're reading this, my former friends stole a great prize from this shipwreck and took it to Hazak's Hollow. It's worth a king's fortune. Kill those whoresons and it's yours!",
        "Getting sleepy now. What a life. This place is a piss-pot. Good riddance."
