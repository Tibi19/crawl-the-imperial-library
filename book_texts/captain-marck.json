        "To the attention of Captain Albert Marck, with my most humble respects.",
        "Captain, I greatly look forward to gracing Sentinel with my presence next month. I wanted to write to thank you for all the preparations you've made for my arrival.",
        "I wanted to let you know that you've been in touch with someone in my extended organization, a confidante named S'rashi. You may have met him, yes? He's been confirming the bodyguards, the food preparation, etc.",
        "He's also informed me that most of the bodyguards you've hired are former elites from the Ring of Daggers, that unique poisons based on sweetened moon-sugar have been imported from Morrowind, and that representatives of King Fahara'jad's inner circle have been seen entering and leaving your residence late at night.",
        "I hope this finds you well. And that my advance team finds you sleeping.",
        "Regards,\n\u2014 Krin Ren-dro"
