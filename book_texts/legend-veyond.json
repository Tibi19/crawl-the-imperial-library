        "Deep within those crumbling walls, where memories are said to speak and the dead mingle with the living, waits a treasure unlike any other. Its origins are unknown, but those brave enough to venture into the ruins of Veyond have brought back the words that were spoken to them by those who died long ago.",
        "",
        "Most notably, the ghost of a young adventurer who battled monsters and night creatures through the halls in search of a cure for his ailing mother's sickness. He can be seen fighting his enemies in a corridor buried beneath the ground. Each time he staggers under the assault, he talks to his mother as if he can hear her voice. There are moments when he speaks to her as if to reassure her that he is coming back, but other times tears can be seen on his face while he tries to placate her angry spirit.",
        "",
        "In a different part of the ruin, children can be heard playing among the rocks. A blacksmith's hammer can be heard, but only on nights when the stars hide behind the clouds. Rarer still, during storms, a voice chanting and speaking in an unknown language can be heard just before thunder rumbles through the cracks in the walls. Whatever else Veyond holds, one thing is clear. It gives up neither its dead nor its secrets quietly.",
