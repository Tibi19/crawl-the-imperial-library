        "You've received this letter because you're a businessman in Riften who's sick and tired of being pushed around by the Black-Briar Family and their cronies. You're sick of the Thieves Guild taking your last coin from your already meager earnings. And you're sick of the corruption that runs through Mistveil Keep like a disease. We at the Society of Mercantile Freedom in Riften are behind you and wish to unify to fight our common enemies! Join us, and together we'll stand up and smash the injustice that's ruined this once-fine city. If you're interested in becoming a part of our organization, simply mark your business with a white x and you'll be contacted by a representative.",
