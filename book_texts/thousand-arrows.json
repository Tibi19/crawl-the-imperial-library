        "The Thousand Arrows was a Champion shrouded in mystery. She entered the tournament alone, yet she bested all the other gladiators with skill and precision, and did not suffer a single wound herself. After Hagrof the Righteous fell, The Thousand Arrows remained in seclusion, only emerging when a new challenger entered the arena. Her favored weapon was a bow equipped with poison-tipped arrows. The poison itself was from a recipe of her own devising. The slightest scratch could fell the largest opponent in seconds. She took this recipe to her grave, and its precise ingredients are hotly debated by alchemists all across Tamriel to this day.",
