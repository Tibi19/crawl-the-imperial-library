        "The God of Schemes blesses us. The Lord of Brutality strengthens us. The Harvester of Souls grants us everlasting power. Mortal hosts cannot stand against us.",
        "The ritual of summoning shall lend us unlimited servants for our domination. Our faith in Molag Bal gives us control over them. We are his chosen servants; his select among a favored few. Our slaves shall bow down before us. They will make our desires their reality.",
