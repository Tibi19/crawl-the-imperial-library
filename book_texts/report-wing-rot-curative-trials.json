        "The most recent formula is nothing short of a miraculous success. When administered to young healthy gryphons and those in the early stages of the disease, the results are total remission of symptoms and full recovery. Although most developing gryphons in the advanced stages of the disease are driven from the nest and eaten by welwas, those that survive can also be treated. Though their wings may need to be amputated, their wounds will no longer suffer from chronic infection, so the creatures may live out comfortable lives in captivity.",
        "With your approval, Conservator, we may begin manufacture and distribution of the wing rot cure to our rangers and administer it to gryphons in the wild."
