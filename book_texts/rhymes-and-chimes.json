        "As I lie beneath you\nNestled in your embrace\nI am moist with morning dew\nFrom the time we spend enlaced",
        "Basking under the sun's golden kiss\nI am hot as humid air,\nMy breath exhales as mist\nUntil the warmth is more than I can bear",
        "I wet my scales, slick with mud\nShaded by your caring boughs\nAmong your loving roots I cool my blood\nAnd then begin to drowse",
        "You sing me a gentle lullaby\nOf chimes in the breeze\nTo plant your seed in my mind's eye\nAnd give me dreams of trees."
