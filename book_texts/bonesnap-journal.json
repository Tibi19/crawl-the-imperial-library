        "I've now been among the creatures of Bonesnap for thirty-six days. The Goblins are predictably skittish, but otherwise unconcerned with my presence. The Ogres they share the space with are another matter entirely. Luckily it's not been too difficult to stay out of their way. The symbiotic relationship between the Ogres and the Bonesnap tribe is fascinating. I've not encountered anything like it in my research before.",
        "Tomorrow I will attempt to approach one of the Bonesnap tribe directly. I'm on the cusp of an inter-species breakthrough! I can feel it."
