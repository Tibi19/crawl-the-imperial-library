        "Of all of my reasons,\nSpring is my first and favorite of seasons.\nTo see the blue water shine in the sun,\nor the green trees inviting a climb - oh, what fun!",
        "The air is cool and I am without thought,\nAs I sleep on the rocks which aren't yet too hot.\nAnd I wake to see endless fields of green grass,\nNot faded pastures or a leaf-covered mass.",
        "This is why Spring is my first and favorite of seasons.\nSummer, Fall, and Winter? All have lesser reasons."
