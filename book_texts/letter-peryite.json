        "I know you will never read this, but I need to thank you in writing for listening to my prayers. This letter is written to you, but it is not for you. This letter is for all the non-believers. The doubters. The ones who scoffed when I told them the Old Gods would wash away their evil. I prayed to every Daedric Prince, but you were the one who answered. The one who saw that the only way to fix this city was to kill it from within and burn it to the ground. Even as the flu spreads through my body and the blood flows from my mouth, a smile crosses my face, and a single phrase circles my fevered mind.",
        "Thank you, Peryite."
