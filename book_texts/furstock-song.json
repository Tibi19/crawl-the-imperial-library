        "CHORUS\nClever Dagi, agile Suthay, burly Pahmar, Senche-raht,\nWhen Azurah gave out presents, she sure gave us a lot,\nHandsome Cathay, nimble Tojay, sneaky Ohmes and Alfiq,\nSo many shapes and sizes, that's what makes us unique!",
        "Now, we all adore the Dagi, who love climbing trees,\nFar better than the Wood Elves with their pink and knobby knees,\nThey swing between the branches with quickness and real ease,\nAs lovely as a feather in a light midsummer breeze.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Here's some good advice: just leave the senches alone,\nTheir claws are sharp as razors and their jaws can break your bone,\nThey'll rip an Elf to pieces in the blink of an eye,\nSo only pick a fight if you are eager to die!",
        "CHORUS",
        "Our dear old mum, Azurah, made the Alfiq so small,\nThat when they hunker down you just can't see them at all,\nThey say that it is magic! Who am I to argue?\nThere really is no limit to the things Khajiit can do!",
        "CHORUS"
