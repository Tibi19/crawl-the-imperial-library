        "One of the oldest esraj known to exist, Tenderclaw cemented Rimmen's reputation as a destination for bards from across Tamriel. For years the renowned Khajiit skald Ahn-eks'kha played it during her week-long performances of the epic poem, The Death of Fadomai.",
        "No musician since has achieved the perfect, enchanting sounds that Ahn-eks'kha coaxed from the instrument. Legend says Tenderclaw was gift from the Khajiiti gods. Whether she was chosen or not is something Ahn-eks'kha would never clarify, preferring the allure of mystery."
