        "Many drummers accompanied the armies of Reman as he defended Skyrim from the Akaviri. This drum, which belonged to one of those soldiers, was likely present at the Battle of Pale Pass when the Akaviri knelt before Reman. Though it served in the regiments of several more leaders of the Reman Dynasty, it faded out of use before the last Reman Emperor was assassinated. Since then, the drum has passed from jarl to jarl by inheritance, gift, or conquest.",
        "The drum now sounds on the feast days of the great heroes of Skyrim."
