        "Tirdas\nWe arrived today to begin our exile here in Aldcroft. Father assures us this town will serve us well as a temporary capital and stronghold from which to retake our home. Our life in Camlorn seems like a dream now, like another time.",
        "Middas\nThe porter, Charles, keeps shooting glances at me when he thinks I do not see. He's a sweet boy, but he should know better. I think Father even noticed. Father has been under such stress lately. I would not want to add to his plate.",
        "Turdas\nI thought to speak to Charles today, but I couldn't find him. No one had seen him since Father asked him to come along to tend to his horse. I asked Father what became of Charles, but he dismissed me angrily. I'm beginning to worry about Charles, and about Father."
