        "Who took up their arms that winter dawn,\nWho to Glenumbria came\nTo raise their hand,\n'Gainst tyrants stand\nAnd to die in freedom's name?\nWho stood on the field upon that hour,\nWho answered Direnni's call?\nMen Breton-born all came that morn\nTo defend the land for all.",
        "CHORUS:\nRise, rise to freedom rise,\nArise ye Breton sons and daughters!\nRide, ride to freedom ride,\nTruth and glory to the brave!\nAnd when the battle it was joined\nAlessians three to one,\nThe sky lit bright\nWith magic's light\nAnd with magic it was won.\nFor all they stood on blessed ground\nWhence all her power came\nThe rocks would yield\nWhat might they wield\nAll in Direnni's name.",
        "CHORUS REPRISE\nSo children of this Breton land\nYe best remember well\nAll those who for High Rock stood\nBrian, Ancois, Rielle;\nMen of the north,\nAll who stood forth\nTill all oppressors fell."
