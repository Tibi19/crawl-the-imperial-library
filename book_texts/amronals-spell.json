        "Who has seen the Amronal of Valenwood?\nI thought I saw her drifting toward me,\nlike a woman I knew a long time ago.\nBut that was a different place,\nmuch colder and not nearly so full of trees.\nThat was before I opened my eyes and shook off the sleep.\nNow I walk the forest, not as a hunter,\nbut as a prey, hoping for a hunter,\nhoping to be tracked, caught, and killed.\nWispmother, ethereal and strange,\ndo not be a ghost to me.\nSnow Elf, do not be a legend.\nRelease me from this restless enchantment,\nwrap me in your spell,\nand let the last word on my lips be your name:\nAmronal."
