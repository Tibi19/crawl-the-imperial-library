        "Kathner,\nBy the time you get this letter, the boat from the Crucible will be just a few days off the coast of Malabal Tor.\nI know we agreed on a thousand gold per ogre, but I'm willing to offer fifteen hundred if you'd come along.\nThese brooding gladiators know nothing of true passion, and it has been far too long since my scales quivered under your supple touch.\nNo one wants to hear an old Argonian beg, but you're not getting any younger either. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in a damp cave with those low-lives?\n\u2014 Beast Master Weerna"
