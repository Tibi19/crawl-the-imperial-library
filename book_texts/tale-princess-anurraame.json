        "Princess Anurraame stepped out onto the balcony, the cold wind whipping her skirts around her legs. She peered upward toward the tower, hoping to see nothing at all \u2026 hoping the servant girl had lied to her. At first she could see nothing but darkness and no sign of movement. She sighed in relief and almost turned to leave, crossing her arms across herself to fend off the biting winds.",
        "But then the clouds parted and the light of the full moon illuminated the tower. Silhouetted against the moon she could see them clearly, her beloved and her sister locked in a passionate embrace.",
        "She stood frozen, unable to move or even to breathe. As she watched her heart darkened and a single tear slid down her cheek."
