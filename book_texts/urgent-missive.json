        "May this message reach you before the arms of our enemy. Falkreath is falling. Our stores are empty, our walls are crumbling, and the walking wounded are all that stands between the hordes of the Reach and our kin.",
        "I hold no illusions that this message will bring us salvation, but I hope it will bring retribution. It is with bent knee that I ask you to send your honored warriors to our hold to drive the Reachmen and their minotaur allies from our lands. Avenge us and rebuild. Don't let the ruin of stone stand as our only memorial.",
