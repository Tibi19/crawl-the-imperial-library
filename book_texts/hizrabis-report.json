        "As you asked, I've taken a closer look at the old ruin north of Do'Krin Monastery. The lunar clergy has some kind of \"proper\" name for it, but the local commoners just call it Claw's Strike. Why is it called that, anyway? Didn't your sister say something about an old battle with the Wood Elves?",
        "Anyway, I took some of the men and made a scouting run. Your sources were correct\u2014there's a sizeable gang of smugglers operating out of the ruin. They're organized, too: they have scouts posted at the door, and Zirri saw some carts stacked with moon-sugar product.",
        "We'll need to proceed carefully. Who knows who's backing them?\n\u2014 Hizrabi-do"
