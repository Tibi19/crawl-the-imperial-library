        "Take your fill of golden mead,\nLet it spill like blood across your blade.\nThe horns of battle call upon the strongest,\nOnly in war are warriors made.",
        "Hone your axes til they gleam,\nLike a light upon the frozen snow.\nRelish in the sweet, sweet sound,\nAs it nestles in the breast of your foe.",
        "No true Nord fears death,\nThey hold it in high regard!\nTake courage, those with hearts so bold,\nA place awaits you in Sovngarde!",
        "There's a cry in every warrior's heart,\nA triumphant, hearty, mighty toll.\nYsgramor's courage steadies your hand,\nHis strength imbues your soul.",
        "No true Nord fears death,\nThey hold it in high regard!\nTake courage, those with hearts so bold,\nA place awaits you in Sovngarde!"
