        "Stibbons has returned with some much-needed supplies, and a guide to the local desert and beyond. I am loath to leave the future of my research in the hands of hired help, but such are the times!",
        "My desert guide professes to know much about Yokudan culture, and yet is ignorant about the post-Schism resurgence of the\"Whimsical Dalliers\"! Honestly, it is hard to find good help these days.",
        "I've found a curious inscription in one of the old ruins. It suggests a unique combination of certain alchemical reagents: I wrote it all down somewhere. I'm sure Stibbons will know where I put it. Think of it\u2014a forgotten recipe from an ancient race! Archeology can be so gratifying."
