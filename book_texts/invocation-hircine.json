        "Mighty Lord Hircine, noble Lord Hircine, we come before you in all obeisance and humility, acknowledging your divine authority over the forest and all the lawful prey therein. We invoke you, O Master of the Chase, in your aspect of Alrabeg the Hunter, to look kindly upon the endeavors of these, your worshipers, as we praise you by engaging in the hallowed tradition of the Hunt.",
        "Ever do we respect the Law of Fair Hunt, never taking a quarry that had no chance of escape.",
        "Ever do we respect the Prey, thanking it for its sacrifice in our worship of you.",
        "Ever do we respect the Huntsman, beseeching your permission even as we loose the arrow.",
        "Bless us as we hunt, O Hircine. Help us to hunt with honor, and bring in prey both lawful and bountiful."
