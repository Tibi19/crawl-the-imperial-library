        "To the most revered Magus-General Septima Tharn,",
        "I know the 7th Legion's first forays into the Hall of Heroes ended rather unfortunately, but I am pleased to report that your generous time spent in teaching me the ways of the occult has proven valuable for us both and the Empire as a whole. After spending weeks poring over Mannimarco's old notes, I have found the key to controlling the spirits of Hel Shira. Not only will this incantation force the spirits to leave your soldiers alone, it will even render the spirits subject to your command.",
        "As ever in awe of your bravery and your brilliance,",
