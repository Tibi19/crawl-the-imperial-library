        "Many questioned our den mother's choice to move to this island. After all, who would see Summerset as a safe haven for our kind? But I've begun to see the wisdom in her decision.",
        "Simply put, the High Elves don't know how to handle werewolves. I suppose it's just not much of an issue on this island, given its isolation. As long as we play it smart, we should be able to keep out of the public eye for quite some time.",
        "There's also the lack of competition. Packs are notoriously territorial, after all. We've lost so many to past conflicts. But I suspect there are few other werewolves here, much less an entire pack. We're more likely to gain numbers than lose them.",
        "Speaking of gaining numbers, I'm glad our den mother is finally listening to reason. We need to strengthen our pack, and the only way to do that is through force. There are few here who would freely accept our blessing. Capturing and turning travelers may be risky, but we must fortify our numbers in case of attack.",
        "Our newest acquisition should do nicely. It's a shame her Wood Elf companion didn't make it, but that's the way it goes sometimes."
