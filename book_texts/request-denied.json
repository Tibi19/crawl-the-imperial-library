        "Your request for transfer is denied. You'll act with deference and attend to Alchemist Ruuvitar's orders or you'll face proscriptive judgment.",
        "I realize punitive expeditions aren't why you signed up, but a soldier's lot isn't to choose orders. Alchemist Ruuvitar's arguably unconventional methods will lead to a quick and humane submission of the Pact, allowing us to focus our attention elsewhere. Never forget that Cyrodiil is our true prize.",
        "And Kazdi, between you and me, your mouth is bigger than the Elden Tree. If he discovers you're the source of the \"Brute-vitar\" nickname, you might just find out the full extent of his experiments firsthand.",
