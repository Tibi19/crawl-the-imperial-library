        "Broken battlements and wrecked walls\nWhere worship of the Horror (1) once embraced.\nThe bites of fifty winters (2) frost and wind\nHave cracked and pitted the unholy gates,\nAnd brought down the cruel, obscene spire.\nAll is dust, all is nothing more than dust.\nThe blood has dried and screams have echoed out.\nFramed by hills in the wildest, forlorn place\nOf Morrowind\nSits the barren bones of Abernanit.",
        "When thrice-blessed Rangidil (3) first saw Abernanit,\nIt burnished silver bright with power and permanence.\nA dreadful place with dreadful men to guard it\nWith fever glassed eyes and strength through the Horror.\nRangidil saw the foes' number was far greater\nThan the few Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers he led,\nWatching from the hills above, the field and castle of death\nWhile it stood, it damned the souls of the people\nOf Morrowind.\nAccursed, iniquitous castle Abernanit.",
        "The alarum was sounded calling the holy warriors to battle\nTo answer villiany's shield with justice's spear,\nTo steel themselves to fight at the front and be brave.\nRangidil too grasped his shield and his thin ebon spear\nAnd the clamor of battle began with a resounding crash\nTo shake the clouds down from the sky.\nThe shield wall was smashed and blood staunched\nThe ground of the field, a battle like no other\nOf Morrowind\nTo destroy the evil of Abernanit.",
        "The maniacal horde were skilled at arms, for certes,\nBut the three holy fists of Mother, Lord, and Wizard (4) pushed\nThe monster's army back in charge after charge.\nRangidil saw from above, urging the army to defend,\nDagoth Thras (5) himself in his pernicious tower spire,\nAnd knew that only when the heart of evil was caught\nWould the land e'er be truly saved.\nHe pledge then by the Temple and the Holy Tribunal\nOf Morrowind\nTo take the tower of Abernanit.",
        "In a violent push, the tower base was pierced,\nBut all efforts to fell the spire came to naught\nAs if all the strength of the Horror held that one tower.\nThe stairwell up was steep and so tight\nThat two warriors could not ascend it side by side.\nSo single-file the army clambered up and up\nTo take the tower room and end the reign\nOf one of the cruellest petty tyrants in the annals\nOf Morrowind,\nDagoth Thras of Abernanit.",
        "They awaited a victory cry from the first to scale the tower\nBut silence only returned, and then the blood,\nFirst only a rivulet and then a scarlet course\nPoured down the steep stairwell, with the cry from above,\n\"Dagoth Thras is besting our army one by one!\"\nRangidil called his army back, every Ordinator and\nBuoyant Armiger, and he himself ascended the stairs,\nPassing the bloody remains of the best warriors\nOf Morrowind\nTo the tower room of Abernanit.",
        "Like a raven of death on its aerie was Dagoth Thras\nHolding bloody shield and bloody blade at the tower room door.\nEvery thrust of Rangidil's spear was blocked with ease;\nEvery slash of Rangidil's blade was deflected away;\nEvery blow of Rangidil's mace was met by the shield;\nEvery quick arrow shot could find no purchase\nFor the Monster's greatest power was in his dread blessing\nThat no weapon from no warrior found in all\nOf Morrowind\nCould pass the shield of Abernanit.",
        "As hour passed hour, Rangidil came to understand\nHow his greatest warriors met their end with Dagoth Thras.\nFor he could exhaust them by blocking their attacks\nAnd then, thus weakened, they were simply cut down.\nThe villain was patient and skilled with the shield\nAnd Rangidil felt even his own mighty arms growing numb\nWhile Dagoth Thras anticipated and blocked each cut\nAnd Rangidil feared that without the blessing of the Divine Three\nOf Morrowind\nHe'd die in the tower of Abernanit.",
        "But he still poured down blows as he yelled,\n\"Foe! I am Rangidil, a prince of the True Temple,\nAnd I've fought in many a battle, and many a warrior\nHas tried to stop my blade and has failed.\nVery few can anticipate which blow I'm planning,\nAnd fewer, knowing that, know how to arrest the design,\nOr have the the strength to absord all of my strikes.\nThere is no greater master of shield blocking in all\nOf Morrowind\nThan here in the castle Abernanit.",
        "My foe, dark lord Dagoth Thras, before you slay me,\nI beg you, tell me how you know how to block.\"\nWickedly proud, Dagoth Thras heard Rangidil's plea,\nAnd decided that before he gutted the Temple champion,\nHe would deign to give him some knowledge for the afterlife,\nHow his instinct and reflexes worked, and as he started\nTo explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,\nAnd watched, puzzled, as Rangidil delivered what the tales\nOf Morrowind\nCalled \"The death blow of Abernanit.\"",

        "Geocrates Varnus explains:\n(1) \"The Horror\" refers to the daedra prince Mehrunes Dagon.\n(2) \"Fifty winters\" suggests that the epic was written fifty years after the Siege of Abernanit, which took place in 3E 150.\n(3) \"Thrice-blessed Rangidil\" is Rangidil Ketil, born 2E 803, died 3E 195. He was the commander of the Temple Ordinators, and \"thrice-blessed\" by being blessed by the Tribunal of Gods.\n(4) \"Mother, Lord, and Wizard\" refers to the Tribunal of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil.\n(5) \"Dagoth Thras\" was a powerful daedra-worshipper of unknown origin who declared himself the heir of the Sixth House, though there is little evidence he descended from the vanished family."
