        "Ceyran was a minor Ayleid warlord of the middle First Era, most famous for building and losing three separate dominions during his long life. It is not clear whether he was a refugee from the Ayleid purges in Cyrodiil, or was born after his clan fled to Valenwood. Rumored to be a devotee of Molag Bal, Ceyran was eventually killed by an unknown assassin in 1E 1102."
