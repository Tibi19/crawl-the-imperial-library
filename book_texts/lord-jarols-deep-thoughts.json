        "She's coming again tonight, though it won't be a private visit. Just another meeting of the powers that be to discuss our common problems. A woman of her bearing shouldn't have to be bothered with \"common problems,\" but at least she's happy to accept my help.",
        "I wonder if she'll wear her pirate sash tonight? I love when she wears her pirate sash. It gives Fortunata such a swashbuckling air that I can barely resist reaching out and swabbing her decks. (Oh, that's clever! I'll have to work that into our next conversation.)",
        "Whenever I'm confounded by such thoughts, I find the view of the sea from my terrace washes away all my cares. Not to mention the wine, which does its share.",
        "Perhaps I can persuade Fortunata to linger after our business is done. I'll break out my best vintage and bring her to this spot. We can drink in the scenery. Together."
