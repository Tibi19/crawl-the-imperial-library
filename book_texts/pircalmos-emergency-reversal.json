        "Dear Pircalmo,",
        "Your enthusiasm and willingness to persevere in the face of stark adversity has never failed to impress me. The arrogant pitfalls of the prodigal will never plague you, a boon that will see you through your future endeavours.",
        "While I will miss you providing me the opportunity to teach others, and am saddened to know that I will not be able to complete your training, I would feel remiss in my duties as a mentor if I did not provide you some parting lesson. To that end, I have devised a ritual for you, the most important a mage of your caliber can learn. It will provide you a means for determining the cause of any calamities you face. When you again find yourself in a position of sudden catastrophe, this spell should start you down the path to correction in my absence.",
        "You will need:\n- The chitin of a hoarvor, for resilience against adversity.\n- Five torchbug thoraxes, that auspicious number.\n- A heartwood fragment, as an anchor.",
        "Incorporate those into Cylladora's Spell of Finding* by way of my own Wonderful Linking Cantrip and the spell should basically cast itself. I haven't yet come up with a name for it. Feel free to come up with your own. \"Pircalmo's Emergency Reversal,\" perhaps? I am sure you can imagine something creative with your newfound free time.",
        "Your (former) teacher,\nTelenger",
        "* I know you are familiar with this particular spell, as I have seen you cast it many times prior to my lectures. Intentionally leaving behind one's notes in order to practice a spell was always a surprising way to practice casting under pressure, but to each their own."
