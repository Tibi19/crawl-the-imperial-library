        "I know that our family carries many burdens. One day, you will lead Hakoshae and ensure the prosperity of our people. For it is you who carries the blood of the Potentate, a connection which proves both blessing and curse. You must prepare.",
        "Our family has never allowed word of our lineage to go beyond Hakoshae's walls for good reason. The Morag Tong still haunts the shadows of Tamriel, and they will not take such news lightly. As descendants of the Potentate, we are seen as loose ends to tie up.",
        "To ensure our family's safety, we must closely guard this secret. It is the only way.",
        "Forever Yours,\nMother"
