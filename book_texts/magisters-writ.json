        "To the Council and esteemed members of Great House Telvanni",
        "I, Magister Therana of Tel Branora, do hereby request and support the elevation of the slave Argonian, Sun-in-Shadow, to rank within our House. She should be lifted from the slave caste and established as a ranked Hireling as soon as possible.",
        "Sun-in-Shadow has shown great initiative and a capacity for careful planning. Her actions, both direct and indirect, led to the acquisition of a valuable relic\u2013an item vital to my research. The fact that she accomplished this feat while still in shackles speaks volumes.",
        "The Council is no doubt aware of Sun-in-Shadow's magical aptitude. Despite her racial handicap, she shows great promise\u2013particularly in the realm of alteration and conjuration. Such talent demands cultivation. The House shall profit from her work, I have no doubt.",
        "Honor and Regards,\nTherana\nMagister of the Great House Telvanni\nMaster of Tel Branora"
