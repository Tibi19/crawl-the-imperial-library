        "Our deception already bears fruit. Go with haste and strike during the meeting. I have sent these loyal soldiers to aid you, but they have orders to keep out of sight unless something goes wrong. If you can, end it quickly with the spell I taught you. I am trusting you to handle this. It is what your sister died for. Make it worthwhile. Do not disappoint me. \u2014 Vicereeve Pelidil"
