        "[This Telvanni retainer's informal history of Nerevar lists no sources.]",
        "When the Dunmer followed Veloth to Morrowind, they were many warring  clans, with no law or leader in common. One Dunmer warlord, Nerevar, had  the ambition to rule all the Dunmer.",
        "In that time, House Dwemer were great enchanters, so Nerevar went in  secret to a Dwemer smith and asked for an enchanted ring that would help  him. The ring gave its wearer great powers of persuasion; for safety,  it was enchanted to instantly kill anyone who wore it except Nerevar.  The ring was called Moon-and-Star, and it helped Nerevar unite the  various clans into the First Council.",
        "Later, however, disputes over religion divided the Council, with House  Dwemer and House Dagoth on one side and all the other Houses on the  other. Dwemer and Dagoth invited Orc and Nord clans as allies, and held  northwest Morrowind, while Nerevar mustered the other Houses and nomad  tribes and marched to meet the Dwemer-Dagoth-Westerner forces.",
        "The armies met at Red Mountain, a Dwemer stronghold. The Dwemer were  defeated, with great slaughter, and terrible sorceries were used,  resulting in the utter extermination of House Dwemer, House Dagoth, and  their allies. Nerevar was killed in the battle, and his ring lost, but  Nerevar's alliance survives in Morrowind's ruling political institution,  the Grand Council."
