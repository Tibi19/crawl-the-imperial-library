        "Our trip to Coldharbour has gone somewhat awry. I do hope this doesn't prove too inconvenient for dear Lady Laurent. She expects things to go smoothly (and quite rightly so).",

        "They hold me within a tower. I will continue to write these notes and drop them from my window until I am rescued. If you are reading this, could I prevail upon you to offer some assistance?",
