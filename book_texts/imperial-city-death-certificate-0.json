        "Deceased: Magistrate Hilo Gerardias\nDate: 30th of Second Seed",
        "Details: Magistrate Hilo Gerardias was killed during the Daedric invasion of the Imperial City. His remains were found in the Imperial Sewers and were positively identified by a friend. Due to circumstances, the remains could not be interred but were rather burned, which explains why there is no proof remaining of the Magistrate's demise. This document should provide all the proof necessary, however, and none should feel compelled to conduct any further investigation in the matter. If there were funds missing from the Magistrate's office, then it's not possible that he absconded with them. They were probably stolen by these Legion Zero soldiers.",
