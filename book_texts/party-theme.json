        "The current theme for our never-ending party is Dance of Death. Make sure the minstrels continue to sing and dance without pause. I especially enjoy Idria's voice\u2014 it is so sweet and melodic! And her dancing is most hypnotic! I want her music to fill these halls. And the way her body moves \u2026 it's poetry in motion! Do not let her stop on pain of death. Yours!",
        "Know that I am holding her prized musical instrument in my upstairs chamber. This will guarantee her compliance. Besides, I might reward her with the honor of playing a private performance for me later in the event.",
