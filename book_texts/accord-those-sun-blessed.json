        "Translated by Solis Aduro",
        "We are the People of the Root. It is as true in this world as any other. Though our roots grow deep into shadow and drink from the tide of memory, our branches rise high into the sky to bathe in the light of the sun. We must unite now and feel the sun's warmth on our scales.",
        "The false prophet has turned our brethren with forbidden lies. They forsake our purpose.They forsake our destiny.",
        "I say to you all, go with me up the river. Leave them to sink into the sea. We will climb the stairs of glory and tear open the sun."
