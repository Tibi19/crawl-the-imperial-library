        "We've stumbled onto a gold mine. Or, more accurately, a Dwarven metal mine. A staggering amount of scrap lies along the bottom of this frozen lake. Had we known how lucrative this trip would be, we would have brought wagons, not buckets.",
        "",
        "Strange machines still stand just above the water. If we could only find what powers them! Riches surely lie in wait, and we can hang our fishing rods up for good. I'll bet we'll find it here, amongst the rest of the scrap. We just need to keep doing what we know how to do best. Fishing.",

        "Sometimes I see a glint, a faint glow at the bottom. But when I cast my line in or try to swim to the bottom to retrieve it, it eludes me.",

        "No luck. We still haven't managed to fish up whatever it is that might power these machines. Jorid jokes we'll need a Dwarven fishing rod to solve this decidedly Dwarven mystery. Schematics are said to lie in a ruined tower at Alftand, in the mountains up north.",
        "",
        "When people speak of me tomorrow, they won't say, \"here comes Faldrin, the fisherman.\" They'll say, \"here comes Faldrin, the treasure hunter!\" We leave for Alftand at first light."
