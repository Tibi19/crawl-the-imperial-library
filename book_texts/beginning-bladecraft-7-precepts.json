        "\u2014 Do not strangle the grip\u2014hold it firmly but lightly in your palm.\n\u2014 The blade curves: the edge is rigid, but the flat is flexible. Learn to feel your sword's range of motion.\n\u2014 Your sword is not the weapon, it is only the point of the weapon. Your entire body is the weapon, and it must move as one.\n\u2014 You expose yourself only when you attack\u2014but if you do not attack, you cannot hit.\n\u2014 The strongest slash is with the forte of the blade.\n\u2014 Move always, defending with stop thrusts, parries, backsteps, and sidesteps. To stand still is to die.\n\u2014 Know your lunge range\u2014and your opponent's. Learn to sense it without looking down."
