        "I can't help but think that joining the Veiled Heritance was a mistake. We're now holed up in Dread Vullain, some kind of haunted Bosmer village. While the bodies are plentiful for our work, it's disturbing to see the echoes of the past repeat themselves.",
        "The creature that commands us was one of Prince Naemon's confidants. I spoke to him once, when both he and Naemon were still alive. It was a short conversation, of no great importance. But now he and Naemon both are unrecognizable.",
        "It shouldn't bother me, a necromancer. But when I look at our leaders, I see nothing of the nobility and virtue that inspired me to join the Veiled Heritance.",
        "I want to return to Summerset. The forest here seems to grow closer as we work. It surrounds us, unruly and unkind. I've always heard Valenwood was alive. Now I know it is."
