        "(A Pirate Song)\nIf you see it glitters bright\nThen take it for your own,\nPile the corpses to a height\nTo make a pirate throne!\nFor what's made weak is ours to break\nAnd what's ill-guarded ours to take\nJust flesh to cut from bone,\nMore flesh to cut from bone.\nIf they try to lock the gates\nWe'll burn the whole damned town\nThey'll bring their guards and magistrates\nAnd then we'll cut them down.\nFor what's made weak is ours to break\nAnd what's ill-guarded ours to take\nJust flesh to cut from bone,\nMore flesh to cut from bone.\nThey'll bring their soldiers by the score\nTo drive us from their lands\nBut we will have a hundred more\nIn our brave pirate band!\nFor what's made weak is ours to break\nAnd what's ill-guarded ours to take\nJust flesh to cut from bone,\nMore flesh to cut from bone.\nAnd if they cry for mercy, then\nWe'll answer them with steel\nFor pity's made for other men\nWe'll grind beneath our heel.\nFor what's made weak is ours to break\nAnd what's ill-guarded ours to take\nJust flesh to cut from bone,\nMore flesh to cut from bone."
