        "My brothers in the Lion Guard stripped my rank when I refused to swear to King Emeric. Others who refused the oath became victims of court politics, stripped of their high status and sent to live with the vagabonds. I'm lucky; I found status amongst the farmers outside Evermore.",
        "Our problems multiplied when the king started his war with Cyrodiil. The farmers trust me to help them. I'm flattered by the attention."
