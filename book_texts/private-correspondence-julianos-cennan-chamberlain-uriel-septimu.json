        "The Emperor questioned the heroes closely. One said that, when struck by the enchanted sword, Dagon appeared to have been sucked away and compressed into an ever-smaller volume, and then to have disappeared. The Emperor then inquired among his counselors how long we might be free of the Prince of Destruction. Their answers were various, hopeful, and unpersuasive. 'You have done all that might be done, sighed the Emperor, but Oblivion cannot long hold Dagon, and when he returns, he surely will count us among his most-cherished enemies.'"
