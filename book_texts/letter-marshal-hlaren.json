        "The last group of prisoners you sent me to work my fields have proven less resilient than I'd hoped. They are, without exception, lazy, slow, and dull-witted. Then again, no one ever said Bretons and Bosmer make good slaves. I miss the days when you could buy a dozen strong Argonians for the price of a sturdy wagon.",
        "As soon as possible, I'd like a few of those strong Nords you sent over to Kharekh. As she and I have both agreed to your \"work for compensation\" plan, we both deserve an equal share of the resources. I refuse to settle for lower quality workers. Send me only your strongest and brightest.",
        "I have it on good authority that a group of Nords will be traveling through Suran soon on a trading mission. If you manage to arrest one or two, I'd be happy to take them off your hands. Until then, I remain your friend and confidant.",
