        "It sleeps like a giant, our tower of stones,\nRed Mountain, Red Mountain, all rumbles and moans.\nIt tosses and turns, pray it won't wake,\nAnd then without warning the ground starts to shake!\nAs the world ends, the ground starts to shake! So\u2014",
        "Heft a flask and say a prayer,\nRed Mountain's about to explode.\nHave a drink but be aware,\nIt's doom the mountain forebodes.",
        "Lift a glass and curse the day,\nRed Mountain's about to burst.\nDrink all your cares away,\nWho wants to die with a thirst?\nDie with a thirst!",
        "Knock back a fiery flin, amid the smoke and ash.\nDrain the flask of whiskey we'll be drunk in a flash!\nLet's guzzle sujamma amid the fire and fumes\nTip back the jar of liquor let inebriation bloom!\\nAs the world ends, let inebriation bloom! So\u2014",
