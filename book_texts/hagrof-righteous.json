        "As Champion, Hagrof was known for his honor, humility, and respect for his fellow gladiators. He was known to honor his vanquished foes with proper burials in accordance with the customs of their people. When he was finally defeated, after staggering to the center of the arena, bleeding from a hundred wounds, it is said that the gladiators of every race stood in silent salute, then carried his body to an ancient pyre and gave him a funeral worthy of a Nord king.",
