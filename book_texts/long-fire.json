        "This tanbur is an example of Yokudan artistry. It is believed this instrument was owned by a sword-singer in Frandar Hunding's expedition to Hammerfell.",
        "According to custom, Yokudan bards considered their instruments sacred, imbued with a divine spirit. Long Fire was named for quiet nights in the deep desert when a bard would gather with his companions to play the songs of their lost homeland by the light of the stars and a low-burning fire."
