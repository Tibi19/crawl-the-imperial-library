        "Fulfilling the edicts of the Order, Brother Talsnir and I have journeyed to Northwind village. We see no need for an outreach mission to this settlement. While the inhabitants are clearly in need of saving, they express hostility at any attempt at enlightenment.",
        "Mining and the acquisition of worldly goods are these workers' only concerns. Even the overseers think only of accumulating enough gold to abandon this backwater to the less fortunate. Our presence here brings us only curses and blows.",
        "In the morning, barring the unforseen, we will leave in search of more fertile fields for our mission. I will post this missive once we reach something resembling civilization.",
