        "What is the secret to easy cooking mastery? It can be summed up in one word: Recipes! When you have a recipe for a dish\u2014especially if it comes from the Malachite Chef!\u2014it takes all the guesswork out of preparing a meal. So beg, borrow, or steal (I jest, I jest) some recipes, acquire the necessary ingredients, and combine as directed over a hot cook-fire. You'll be a master provisioner in no time!",
        "Because I'll let you in on a little professional secret: nineteen out of twenty times, even top-ranked chefs do exactly the same thing! Oh, we may add a special spice here or there to personalize a recipe, but we know better than to ignore them entirely. A proven recipe represents the collective experience of generations of cooks. Whether you're making something as simple as a Cyrodilic sweet roll or as complicated as a screaming-cheese fondue, in the kitchen a recipe is your best friend!"
