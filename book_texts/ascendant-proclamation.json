Our enemies are those who seek to keep you in bondage, who hoard power and authority in all lands. We bring you the means to rise up against those who rule over you, so that you can rule yourselves!",

What grievance do the Redguards hold against the Dark Elves? None and none! Why should you fight so that some greedy monarch can subjugate new lands and peoples?",
