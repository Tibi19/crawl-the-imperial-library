        "To master the art of necromancy, one requires a constant supply of corpses upon which to practice.",
        "",
        "Here on the coast I can practice my arts undisturbed, save for a lone fisherman I convinced to let me rest in his shack. Amazing how far a few potions and fire salts can take you.",
        "",
        "Soon, I will begin the pacification ritual that will bring me wave after wave of docile creatures to slay and practice my abilities.",

        "Already I feel myself growing stronger in the dark arts. I bring down the knife, and see life's flame extinguished from their eyes. Then I raise my hand, and see it spark once more. I bring the knife back down again. The others watch on, their feeble minds unable to resist.",

Perhaps my illusion has had some kind of adverse effect on them, driving them to frenzy instead of calm submission.",

        "I will dispel the illusion for now and make do with the creatures I find close to the shore.",

        "More have come from the sea with deadly intent, this time almost too many to manage. I need to be careful.",
