        "Master harpists played the Aldmeri harp Lilytongue in the High Court of Alinor since time immemorial. Lilytongue was the instrument used in some of the most enchanting arias produced by the great composer Rolmelval. The harp disappeared during the War of the Uvichil and was presumed destroyed. A new royal harp was commissioned to replace it.",
        "Lilytongue resurfaced in the last century after being lost for more than five hundred years. It now sits in a place of honor in the Bards College as an example of the history, eminent beauty, and unparalleled artistry of the High Elf crafters."
