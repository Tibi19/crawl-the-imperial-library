        "I have the miller's horse and cart ready to go as soon as we have what we came for. As long as no one tries to be a hero, we should be in the clear. Tell Bulzog to keep the hostages at the old mill south of town. If he doesn't hear from us by midnight, he can start slitting their throats. Since the miller's given us so much trouble, Bulzog can kill his daughter either way. But when we send word that we're clear of town, he should release the mayor's wife and the jeweler's son and then meet us back at camp.",
