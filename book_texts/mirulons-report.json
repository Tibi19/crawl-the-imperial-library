        "Our plans for Shimmerene continue apace. Some improvisation was required, but the plot remains on schedule. The youth I mentioned in my last report predictably abandoned the task we set before him. I made it very clear that the Sapiarch must die by his hand. He refused. In light of this defiance, I have resolved to make him do it through mind-sculpting. It should not take long before he is my thrall.",
        "I regret that his recovery required a small explosion in the city proper. This no doubt attracted the attention of the Divine Prosecution. But I assure you\u2014they will not have a chance to interfere. Very soon, the Sapiarch will be slain and this city will fall into turmoil. I will contact you again when the task is completed.",
