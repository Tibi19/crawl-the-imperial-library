        "I have already sent word to the exalted high priest. The steward and three of the councilors are dead. Only Councilor Itinia eludes us, as the councilor is not currently in the province of Blackwood.",
        "",
        "I have also sent the documents we uncovered from the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary. With that information, the high priest should have no trouble determining the hidden location of the first of the Four Ambitions. More over, I have ordered the attack on Leyawiin Castle. Soon the documents kept by the other councilors will be ours. Then the locations of all the Ambitions will be revealed.",
