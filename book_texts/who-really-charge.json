        "I have discovered conclusive proof that a secret cabal of elite mages working in hidden catacombs beneath every major city in Tamriel invented this so-called \"Planemeld\" as part of their devious plan to control all of Tamriel.",
        "There is no \"Molag Bal.\" He's a myth. A clever fiction. These \"Dark Anchors\" are actually mind-control devices constructed by the Cabal and placed throughout the world. Do not approach these devices under any circumstances. They will cause you to hallucinate, see all manner of monsters and demons, and very likely force you to kill yourself by falling on your own sword.",
        "All three Alliance leaders know of and support this cabal. In fact, they are all practicing members. DO NOT BE FOOLED."
