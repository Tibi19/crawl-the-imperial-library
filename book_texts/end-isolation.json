        "By Royal Decree of the Ceremoniarchy of Queen Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri, Monarch of the Throne of Alinor and Eagle Primarch of the Aldmeri Dominion, the Summerset Isle's long period of isolation is declared at an end. No longer will the brave and selfless Altmer hide from the world like spoiled or frightened children. No longer will we cut ourselves off from our allies and friends. Instead, we shall welcome them as brothers and sisters as we throw open the metaphorical gates of our ancestral home and make Summerset accessible to everyone who arrives with friendship in their hearts and an unquestioned desire to engage in dialogue, commerce, and diplomacy.",
        "To accommodate this mandate, we must all put aside our preconceived notions and innate prejudices. We must open our hearts and share our bountiful land with the world. I need the proud Altmer of Summerset to forgive ancient grievances and forget old animosities. We must embrace the differences in stature and culture, thereby allowing friendship to blossom in our breasts. This is not only my steadfast dream, but my royal command.",
        "Kinlords and Kinladies, Canonreeves, agents of the Divine Prosecution, citizens of Summerset, make no mistake. The will of your queen and the meaning of this mandate are perfectly clear: The island of Summerset is no longer off limits or forbidden to the lesser races. Everyone who meets the standards of honor, integrity, and enterprise are welcome, travelers, traders, and immigrants alike. In friendship we formed the Aldmeri Dominion, and in friendship we shall make Summerset an even more perfect paradise. This is not only my fondest wish, but my royal command."
