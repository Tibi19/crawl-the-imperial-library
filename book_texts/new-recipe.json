        "I've been trying to find a way to prepare troll meat so it's both flavorful and appetizing. The rest of the logging camp would banish me if they knew what culinary experiments I was conducting, but I'm hoping that the fatty flesh and its amazing healing properties might make a healthy and sustainable food source for the foresters.",
        "Would a small piece of troll meat continue to grow, so the pantry would constantly restock itself? I think so, but I need a piece of troll meat to test this theory. Also, there's the fire issue. Troll meat really doesn't react well to fire, and I can't see the foresters eating raw troll flesh.",
        "I'm sure I can work this out. I just need more time."
