        "Dearest Customers,",
        "Congratulations on your purchase! As you can see, I spared no expense importing the finest kwama that Morrowind has to offer. The queen has plenty of loyal guards at her disposal, and egg production is steadily rising every year. All you must do is maintain the colony and reap the benefits.",
        "And rest assured, your initial payment for such a bounty will soon lead to far greater wealth. As the proud owners of the only kwama mine within the borders of Elsweyr, you are the only stakeholders in this currently untapped kwama egg market. Supply Dark Elves with their favorite treat! Tempt the Khajiit with an exotic delicacy! The possibilities are nearly endless!",
        "If you require any assistance, feel free to call upon my residence at once and I will do my utmost to aid you.",
        "Yours truly,\nThe Illustrious Azashig-dro, Humble Merchant"
