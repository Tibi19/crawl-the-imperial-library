        "We can also ferret out the portions of the secret that my fellow councilors are aware of before we execute them. And yes, they must die to preserve the secret of the Longhouse Emperors. We will blame the Dark Brotherhood for their murders, thus deflecting suspicion from the Order of the Waking Flame for as long as possible. Besides, I have recently learned that one of Leovic's caches is hidden in their former Blackwood sanctuary.",

The former chief councilor is too smart for his own good and may realize what is happening and act against us before we can secure the Four Ambitions.",
