        "Enough of these ridiculous rumors! The whisperings of a curse that haunts this mine are being spread by the lazy and hateful among you. They can't stand to see hard work being done, to witness fellow workers being well-rewarded for their labors.",
        "There is no curse. There are no undead creatures in this mine. I promise you this, with the gods as my witnesses.",
        "Do not let vile rumor-mongers destroy your livelihoods and hopes for a better future. Keep working, pay no attention to wild tales, and the mine and all its workers will prosper."
