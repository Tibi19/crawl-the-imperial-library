        "I pen these words through instinct, writing faster than I can see. I can hardly contain my excitement and hardly describe its cause. This fount of knowledge I've discovered\u2014I could drink and drink and never be sated, yet the water is delicious to me and more precious than gemstones.",

        "\"Bring me secrets.\"",
        "I have made my deal with him. I will seek the hidden meanings of the world and bring them to him, and in exchange, I will learn and know all there is to know."
