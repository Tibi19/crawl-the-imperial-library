        "The Dark Elf was smart to choose me. Scars aside, I can pass as a stable boy easily enough. I'll tell the shopkeep I got bucked by a wild one and landed face first into the briars. I'm smart like that.",
        "",
        "The other bandits always poke fun at my face, saying I look like a newborn babe, but it comes in handy for jobs like this. After seeing how well the Dark Elf pays, the entire gang will be looking for a razor pretty soon.",

        "Speaking of which, I'm supposed to meet my mysterious benefactor back at the stables, and not at the Silent Moons Camp. Not sure why, but he says if I'm followed, it's best I stay in character until I'm well clear of the city gates.",
        "",
        "Well, I hope he doesn't sneak up on me while I wait. I nearly soiled myself the last time. But smart guy that I am, I bought this tome to help me find him. Thing is, I opened it up and can't for the life of me figure out how it works. Only a matter of time though for a guy like me."
