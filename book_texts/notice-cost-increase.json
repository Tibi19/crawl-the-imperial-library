        "As of this month, I'm afraid we're going to have to double the cost for Black-Briar Mead. As you're no doubt well aware, there's quite a bit of civil unrest occurring within Skyrim. With this unrest comes increased costs to us for shipment protection, ingredients and labor. I think you'll find your customers more than willing to share in this burden by absorbing the cost through a price increase I recommend you institute immediately. Failure to comply with our new costs will result in an immediate interruption of Black-Briar Mead.",
