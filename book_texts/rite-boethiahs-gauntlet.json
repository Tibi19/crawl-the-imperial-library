        "Over fifty Gauntlets have I witnessed,\nMighty Men and Mer contending, fitly\nOff'ring blood and body, Faithful fighting,\nProving worth and zeal, Boethiah's best and\nMost devoted show they stop at nothing.\nPitted, Faithful versus Faithful, grandly giving\nAll they must to praise their Prince so proudly.\nNone can doubt devotion offered freely.\nTested thus, the Faithful know who's worthy\u2014\nWho shall be the Conduit of Boethiah.\nChampion of Boethiah's also chosen,\nGauntlet given, through the test of melee.\nThose who fear the sword, the mace, and dagger\nLack the heart to show our foes no pity\u2014\nMolag Bal will welcome them to Stonefire.\nWarlock of Boethiah wields the magic\nBetter than the weaklings of Azura,\nCasting spells to pass the test of Gauntlet,\nShowing lesser Faithful their position.\nAll must serve the Prince in their own fashion."
