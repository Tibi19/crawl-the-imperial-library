        "Be steadfast and courageous in the face of adversity. If fear must be borne, let your enemy bear it. For fear is a heavy weight that dries the mouth and dulls the senses. Though the enemy may be legion and your brothers and sisters may lay dead at your feet, you must remain brave and resolute. For bravery is the stone upon which the warrior's temple is built, and the temple stands strong.",
