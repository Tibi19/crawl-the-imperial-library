The author was careful to keep the recipient's identity hidden, along with their own. We must know everything about this medallion, including where it was to be delivered, if we are to ensure the plan unfolds as the Magus intends. Continue to interrogate the prisoner and I permit you to get more creative with his questioning, so long as you don't kill him.",
