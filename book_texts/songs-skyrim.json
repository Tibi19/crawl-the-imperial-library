        "<center>Ragnar The Red\nThere once was a hero named Ragnar the Red,\nwho came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!\nAnd the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade,\nas he told of bold battles and gold he had made!\nBut then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red,\nwhen he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...\nOh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead!\nNow I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!\nAnd so then came the clashing and slashing of steel,\nas the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!\nAnd the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree...\nwhen his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!</center>",

        "The Dragonborn Comes has been handed down from generation to generation of bards. The Dragonborn in Nord culture is the archetype of what a Nord should be. The song itself has been used to rally soldiers and to bring hope.",

        "The Age of Oppression and The Age of Aggression are variants of one song. It isn't known which of the two was written first but the tune, with loyalty appropriate lyrics, is quite popular on both sides of the war.",

        "The Age of Oppression\nWe drink to our youth, and to days come and gone.\nFor the age of oppression is now nearly done.\nWe'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own.\nWith our blood and our steel we will take back our home.\nAll hail to Ulfric! You are the High King!\nIn your great honor we drink and we sing.\nWe're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives.\nAnd when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!\nBut this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean.\nOf the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.",
