        "Nothing-talkers, nothing words\nVoid clinging to their nothing tongues\nA thousand tongues and tenfold words\nTruth steady as their nothing lungs",
        "Their breath of wisdom fouls the air\nLike the fruit so long decayed\nDarkness sticks between their words\nNothing between the something",
        "Their feet will walk many paths\nLined by the Hists' many roots\nTheir lips will speak many truths\nTruths that spread like candlelight",
        "No comfort will they offer you\nNo gentle truths to placate fear\nBut listen closely to their words\nLook upon their nothing eyes"
