        "Word has come to me that some of our jailers have been amusing themselves at the expense of the prisoners. As long as I don't hear anything specific, I will continue to look the other way. I am curious about the so-called contest I've heard discussed around the stockade, but I'd rather not actually know the details. What I don't know, I don't have to write in a report.",

But the one that erupted in the strait yesterday was powerful and immense! It came out of nowhere. I've never seen anything like it, and I've been sailing these seas for decades. And the ground never shook that way in a storm before. Very unusual.",
