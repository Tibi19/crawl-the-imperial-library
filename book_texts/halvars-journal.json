        "Came into town a few days ago looking for work. The folks here are nice enough, and there's plenty of wheat and potatoes needing to be harvested, so I've got a steady supply of coin coming in.",
        "",
        "I don't think I'm going to need my old pack goat Hilda for much longer...all my bones are starting to creak, and my adventuring days are long over. Now I just need to find someone willing to take care of her. Maybe get a few coins for her too - there's strength in those old bones of hers yet.",
        "",
        "Ah, how I'm going to miss wandering the wilds of Skyrim! I saw so many strange and wonderful things out there - pine trees as tall as mountains, old nord tombs, I once even stumbled across a wandering spirit made of pure ice!",
        "",
        "Even ran across a few folks trying their hand at taming different types of creatures. Don't know why they'd want anything but a loyal dog or trusty goat like my Hilda though - some of them beasts out in the wild just aren't meant to be tamed.",
        "",
        "Ran across an alchemist with a pet rabbit, and almost got robbed by a thief with a tame fox, but I suppose a rabbit or a fox could be docile enough. But that pickpocket trying to train a skeever must have been as mad as old Sheo'. And I don't want to think too hard about the vampire that almost made a meal out of me...could have sworn it had a trained frostbite spider! Gives me the shivers just thinking about it."
