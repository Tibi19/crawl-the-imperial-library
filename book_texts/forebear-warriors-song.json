        "Akatosh, my strength comes from your hands,\nMy enemies fall before my sword.\nCan you hear their cries?\nDeath, they cry.\nDeath, I sing.\nBut death is theirs, not mine.\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!\nStendarr, grant my weapon fall only thus:\nFor justice, for the right ways.\nCan you hear my plea?\nJustice, they pray.\nJustice, I sing.\nJustice is mine, and also theirs.\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!\nFor the way of the righteous is mercy,\nAnd compassion for the weak.\nCan I wield your sword and shield?\nMercy, they beg.\nMercy, I give.\nSwift death to the unjust!\nSlow death to the merciless!\nWipe the blade of their color.\nWipe the shield of their color.\nVictory is ours!"
