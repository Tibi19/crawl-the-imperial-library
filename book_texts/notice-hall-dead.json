        "The priest of Orkey is here as part of his sacred duty to the Divines. He is not here to comfort, console, or brighten your day. Should the undead rise from their places of resting, you accept all risk and responsibility to your own safety while inside the hall. The priest is not required to save you from your own idiocy.\n- Hjurring"
