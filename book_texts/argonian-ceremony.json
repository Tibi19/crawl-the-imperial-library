        "I was wondering if you could speak to Maramal about perhaps presiding over a marriage ceremony for myself and Keerava. She's the love of my life and I wish to be with her forever, but only if we can be wed in traditional Argonian fashion. Traditional Argonian bonding ceremonies are somewhat long and complex, involving unique rituals spoken in our native language. I'd be more than happy to provide a book describing what I'm looking for as long as Maramal doesn't mind.",
