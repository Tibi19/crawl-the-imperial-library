        "Khajiiti myths and legends continue to intrigue me. After all, it was the stories of Khunzar-ri, as told by the moon-singers, that led me to the Wrathstone and allowed me to trick my blundering half-brother into releasing the Dragons from the Halls of Colossus.",
        "I wonder what else might be waiting for me in the remaining tales of Khunzar-ri? Certainly, the significance of the Betrayer, whose disgusting head follows my chief necromancer around like a sad, little puppy. He came to us from those legends. And the need for the Moon Gate, though I must admit (at least here in my private notes) that a complete understanding of the metaphysics behind it all still eludes me.",
        "Meanwhile, I understand that our investigation into the rumors of a last surviving member of the Dragonguard here in Elsweyr have finally come to fruition. We can eliminate this potential threat and show Kaalgrontiid the true value of our partnership. I look forward to studying Prefect Calo's report in greater depth.",
        "If the infernal man ever agrees to send it to me."
