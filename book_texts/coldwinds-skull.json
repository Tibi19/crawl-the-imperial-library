        "When King Torug was alive, he allied with the mightiest of the snow bears of Wrothgar. The beast earned the name \"Coldwind\" by being fast and icily brave while serving as the king's mount in hundreds of battles.",
        "After many years, however, Coldwind grew weary. Torug found her a den in the far north. There, the snow bear slept, ate, and mated, passing on her bloodline to many powerful cubs. Eventually, Coldwind succumbed to old age. King Torug turned part of the den into a tomb for his faithful friend and sealed it away.",
        "One day, it is said, Coldwind will rise again. The sign of her reawakening will be the claiming of her skull. Only a hero of Wrothgar can perform this deed - or so the legend say."
