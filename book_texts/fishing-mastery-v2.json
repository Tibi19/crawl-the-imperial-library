        "The fish in this guide come to the surface more often in the rain in the temperate parts of Skyrim. Some say they like the rain, or that they are gloomy fish who hate the sun.",

        "In truth, they enjoy watching the ripples dance along the surface above them and want to join in on the festivities. Even fish want to enjoy themselves from time to time.",
        "",
        "For advice on where to fish, refer to the first volume of this illustrious series of guides. The places are the same, the only difference is... rain! For a change of pace, try fishing along the White River east of Whiterun, and follow it south to Lake Ilinalta.",
