        "Pink Piggy Friends!\nGrunt and squeal and dig.\nDo your best today.\nFor tomorrow you will be in my tummy.\nWhy do you taste so good, Piggy Friends?\nHow does Mother's cookpot transform you?\nOne day you stink of dirt.\nThe next, you smell like the fields of Sovngarde.\nNever change, Piggy Friends.\nAs sisters change and grow bossy.\nAs mothers nag and push.\nAs fathers moan and grumble.\nRemain like you are.\nDelicious."
