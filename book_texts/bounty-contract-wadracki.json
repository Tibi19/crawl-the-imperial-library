        "The parties in question (hereafter \"employers\") agree that with the confirmed kill of Wadracki, the Dremora, Orchenir will be paid four times the standard pay for braving the hazards of the Imperial City sewers.",
        "The employers also accept and understand that if Wadracki is spotted at some point in the future, that this is the nature of the Daedra to reform after some time spent dead. The employers will not seek damages from Orchenir in the case that Wadracki returns."
