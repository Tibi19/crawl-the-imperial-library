        "29 Sun's Height\nI know not what force drags us up from our eternal rest, but the call cannot be denied. I did not study the Daedric Princes much in life, but bound to them now in death, I regret that.",
        "Maybe if I knew more, I could save us from this terrible duty. Whatever this force or being is, it grows closer. Crawling. Pulling. The very world seems to rebel against it, but to no avail.",
        "12 Evening Star\nNirn ends soon, this I know. And it ends in a tide of corpses."
