        "Do not weep for your father, for he goes to join his father.\nDo not weep for your mother, for she goes to join her mother.\nTake only account of yourself, for you will go to join your father and your mother one day as they went to meet theirs.\nTreat your children well, for they too will one day come to join you.\nPray for your children's children, for one day they will raise children of their own who will also come to join you.\nWalk proudly every day with the firm knowledge in your heart that you will go home.\nYou will walk through the Hall of Heroes and find your way to the eternal sands of the Far Shores.\nIt has been this way and will be this way for all Ra Gada who walk under the watchful eye of Tu'whacca."
