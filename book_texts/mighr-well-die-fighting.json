        "Going to die here. Damned Goblins. They caught Miari and Tullias while we were exploring the ruins. Jumped us, didn't even know they were there. Goblins dragged them both to the fires, spitted them and roasted them.",
        "Didn't think the buggers ate cooked meat, maybe just torturing their victims. Miari screamed forever.",
        "Ran up the tower stairs while the others fought. Not proud of it. Just ran, never been so scared. Hid up here while the others died. Goblins missed me. One snoops up here every few minutes. I swear it smells me.",
        "Can't stay up here much longer. Hungry, getting weak. Might as well die fighting, while I still can."
