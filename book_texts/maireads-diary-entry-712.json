        "My hands are still shaking. I can hardly write, but I need to get this down. I need it out of my head. If I don't write it down, how will I know it really happened? How could I convince myself it wasn't just a nightmare?",
        "",
        "It all happened so quickly. Horrible, twisted-looking men tried to take me. They wouldn't say why, though a few screamed a name I didn't recognize. Valkynaz Nokvroz.",
        "",
        "I almost couldn't believe my eyes. They came in such force! This vault has never held so many living things at once. It felt as though the walls were trembling with sheer indignation at the noise and the strangeness of it all. Blood rushed in my ears. The twisted forces that invaded my home grabbed at my arms until I bruised. I lashed out, kicked wildly, I screamed, though I knew how futile that was, even then. There would be no one to hear me. How many times have I screamed in this place, knowing the echo was the only answer I'd receive?",
        "",
        "But just when I thought they had me, something inside me broke free. It cracked like a whip inside my chest and tore out of me. I can't remember if I felt pain or felt nothing at all. The sensation overwhelmed me entirely. I wanted to scream but there was no air left in my lungs. For a moment, all I saw was light. The brightness washed out everything, it flooded every corner, chased every shadow. And then, nothing.",
        "",
        "When I woke, bodies littered the floor. The others were gone. Once again, I was alone. I don't know what's happening, but I feel like something is about to change. Forever.",
