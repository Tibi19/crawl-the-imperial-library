        "Black thorns choke a prison ruined\nA creature of root lurks at the gate\nIt has eaten the sun, which shines no longer",
        "A nut has fallen from its branch\nAnd landed upon mossy stone\nIt looks eastward towards the open sea",
        "Deep within the murky mire\nA single sprout grows on the stone pile\nAn abandoned nest, with nothing steps",
        "The reeds of a sunken ship rots\nAs trade ships pass, heading north\nIt shades a sapling of the Hist",
        "In hollow echoes, past thundering roots\nLies a Hist that has matured\nDeep within the winding cavern",
        "Where sea meets swamp, below cliff's edge\nBehind Imperial stone coated in black\nAn elder Hist sits in water cool",
        "In the outskirts of a town without Hist\nAn egg basket sits inside a stone nest\nBuilt by uncertain dryskin hands",
        "Stone snake protects stone egg\nBetween two pillars of our past follies\nTo the west, the haj mota lurks",
        "In a vault of withering roots\nHidden behind towering stone\nThe lizard sits, waiting",
        "North of water bereft of life\nRoots lurk at the edge of the swamp\nIn its belly, the walking lizard",
        "Near the maw of void\nWalking roots have swallowed our kin\nBeneath the rumbling waterfall",
        "A final season of death\nLies within your final rooted foe\nClose enough to hear the whispering roots"
