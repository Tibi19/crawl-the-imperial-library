        "King Torug founded the original Orsinium as more than just another Orc settlement. He envisioned a grand city of prosperity and civilization\u2014but he wanted it to be a reflection and advancement of Orc culture. To this end, he created a set of rights and privileges that defined the organization of the city, a document now known as the First Charter.",
        "The First Charter preserves what Torug thought was most important about Orc life. When the first Orsinium fell, the First Charter was believed to be destroyed. But legend has it that the book survived as part of some raider's booty. The raider was killed on his way back to the coast and the book lost somewhere in the western mountains."
