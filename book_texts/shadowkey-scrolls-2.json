        "...Azra attempted what had never been done before, manipulating his own  shadow to such and extent that he instantiated and melded all possible  Azras at the same time, crossing over from this singular existences in  shadow. Ignorant Redguard soldier, fearing the power of Azra should he  succeed, trapped and confronted Azra. The battle did not go well for the  wizard. The hole blasted when he lost control of his magics can still  be seen at the village that bears his name, Azra's Crossing. The science  of shadow lost a great man that day, although others, such as Pergan  Asuul, strive to take his place."
