        "My sweet, my blade, my lady love.\nYour pommel fits my hand like an armored glove!",
        "I promise to never let our attraction dull,\nEven when we've crushed his skull!",
        "Our blade of love need never sharpen,\nWhile we cuddle behind the curtain darken!",
        "With your keen love ever near,\nMy heart never knows the touch of fear!"
