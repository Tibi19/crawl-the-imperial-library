        "The soft-skins can't do their dirty work alone, but who are we to refuse their gold? They want to break up some stupid wedding, then help them \u2026 but be smart.",

        "Turn the Silvenar over to the Houndsmen for their ritual, but keep any other captives separate. I'll question them later. And don't let the tribes fight! We get our way, and the Dominion will be sorry for excluding us."
