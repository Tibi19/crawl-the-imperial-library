        "When I will come a-courtin'\nAll to the Shornhelm maids\nI'll have a cart all full of silk\nAnd ribbons for their braids.\nAnd wandered he all through the planes\nSearching for his bride\nBut Akatosh has cast him out\nIn sanction for his pride.\nOne crown to glory bring\nBut only blood and death to show them\nOne crown to glory bring\nFor Ranser's folly, died."
