        "I had hoped to see you before I set out, but it seems you've gone to ground\u2014hiding out in the old wine cellar, no doubt. I know exactly where too\u2014behind the old cask of Alinorian in the southeast corner right? You were always rubbish at hiding! I'd come find you, but my ship leaves with the tide.",
        "I know you're scared of being alone, and angry at me for leaving, but I just can't turn my back on the opportunity to study with the elders on Balfiera. A chance to see the great Direnni tower! I hope, in time, you'll understand.",
        "You're stronger than you know, little sister. You don't need me to protect you anymore. Just keep reading, and keep writing those beautiful songs. I'll be back before you know it.",
        "Your loving sister,\nSelenwe"
