        "Still, I have borne witness to the acts of gods and they are no less awesome. I have seen Khajiit join the Pride of Alkosh! I have seen Jone and Jode speak their thunderous blessings and imbue the faithful with their incredible might! I pray that I may prove my worth and gain their favor soon.",
