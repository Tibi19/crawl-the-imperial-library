        "I'm not sure who or what it is I have to fight, but I doubt it's gonna be fair. The Pit Champion's got this big, powerful meat cutter on her back. Meanwhile they left me an iron sword so old it had mushrooms growing on it.",

        "Maybe one of the other poor sods who've fought before me has something that isn't completely useless. If these pit fighters killed a soldier or two, I'm guessing they didn't bother cleaning up the mess.",
