        "And she keeps taking all our gear and putting it on the shelves, but she mixes them all up! What if there is an attack and we can't get out the door in time because we can't find our own boots?",
        "I know you feel bad for the old lady, but if you can at least keep her out of the barracks, we'd all appreciate it.",
