        "There's a plan to liberate the abbey from that tyrannical Arbitrator Gavos. I spoke to his soldiers and learned they're not so different from the rest of us. Just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. They don't like what their boss has been doing either and they're willing to help the people stop it. With them on our side, we can topple the arbitrator without a fight.",

One for each of the trade-ministers. All three of them would have to agree to release him, so you can pretty much guarantee that bastard will never see the light of day again!",
