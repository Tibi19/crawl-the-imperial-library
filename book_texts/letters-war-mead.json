        "Today I visited a beverage maker not too far distant from the amazing city of Windhelm. The place is called Voljar's Meadery, and they craft and serve the most wonderful potation I have ever had the good fortune to pour down my throat. They call it mead! And you'll never guess what the primary ingredient is. Fermented honey! That's right, they actually make it using nectar regurgitated by bees! Oh, I mean xouch, those flying insects with the stingers that buzz around your flower garden.",
        "Anyway, the Nords love the stuff, so I figured I'd give it a try while I was here. It was delicious! I may have to learn the recipe from one of the crafters so I can make this wonderful concoction when I return to Murkmire.",
        "I never did quite understand why they had an Orc head on a pike in front of their property, but there are many Nord customs that make absolutely no sense to me.",
