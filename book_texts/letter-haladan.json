        "Dear Haladan,",
        "How good it feels to write you again. I apologize for the long gaps in our correspondence. The trade ministry set an aggressive schedule when Queen Ayrenn sent out her decree, leaving me little time for personal matters. I've spent most of the last month at sea.",
        "Now it comes to it. I must share some ill news with you. I recently found myself stranded on a remote island for a few days\u2014the result of gross negligence on our navigator's part. Everyone who set foot on that cursed island (including me) contracted a horrifying illness. A fatal illness that turns the skin to stone and drives sufferers to lunacy.",
        "Even now, I feel my joints stiffening and my mind wanders constantly. I wish to see you one last time before this sickness claims my body and mind. Will you see me? I can reach Lillandril by month's end.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon.",
        "Most Sincerely,\nNorasea"
