        "I don't care if Obor was right. I don't care if there's enough treasure in this sunken barrow to sink the Dominion Fleet! All I care about now is getting out of this dreadful place in one piece!",
        "Who knew that when the legends referred to a place where the ancient Nords buried the worst of the worst, they weren't exaggerating? And who knew that the worst of the worst refuse to lay down and stay dead like other corpses I've known and robbed?",
        "If I get out of this, Obor isn't going to like the conversation we're going to have. And if I don't get out of this, maybe I can get these undead to teach me what they know.",
        "Because if I die in here, I really want to haunt Obor for the rest of his miserable existence."
