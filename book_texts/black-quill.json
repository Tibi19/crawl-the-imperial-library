        "For a culture that relies so heavily upon oral tradition and storytelling, few Orcs ever write anything down. The legend of Razotha Tale-Teller is a notable exception.",
        "Razotha the bard wasn't satisfied with being the greatest storyteller of her age. She wanted to guarantee that her stories would persist. So she commissioned a High Elf wizard to enchant a black feather plucked from a hagraven, creating the Black Quill.",
        "Any story written using the Black Quill will never be forgotten, or so the legends claim. Razotha pass the enchanted quill to her apprentice, and it was passed down this way until it and its last owner were lost near Coldperch Cavern\u2014the home of the hagraven the black feather was plucked from."
