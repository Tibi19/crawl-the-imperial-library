        "2nd of First Seed",
        "For a moment today, I glimpsed something which I had not even dreamed possible, a love so forbidden that I did not even recognize my own feelings. Even now, I must wonder\u2026 that look, was it just my imagination?",
        "10th of First Seed",
        "Again, that elusive impression. As we walked together in the street, her hand brushed past mine, and I sensed a desire to allow that touch to linger. Am I really just imagining this? It can't be real.",
        "20th of First Seed",
        "I can't stop thinking about her. Not just her, but us. She has so many admirers. Why would she have any interest in someone like me? I need to just put this idea out of my head. There. It's gone.",
        "25th of First Seed",
        "It happened. I think I knew in my heart all along that it would. But it surpassed any expectations I might have entertained. I can't believe it. I can't believe I wasn't just imagining things. I must be the luckiest man in the world.",
        "10th of Rain's Hand",
        "Reality has set in. Though the physical attraction is there and the emotion is genuine, our romance must always remain a secret. For a moment, I expected something more, but that was childish of me. I see that now.",
        "25th of Rain's Hand",
        "I've come to terms with our situation, and I'm actually finding our secrets to make the whole relationship that much more exciting. No one in town, not even anyone in the house has any idea what's really going on. We're going to keep it that way."
