        "When white light is passed through a gas under a medium dense gas at high temperature, a dynamic thermal instability occurs. Since magicka is usually a very faint source of illumination, gases, under much greater pressure, are forced to combine with degenerated matter, creating dual forces, beyond and beneath. The end result is a quasi-horizontal chonolith composed of anastomosing ductoliths, whose distal ends curl like a harpolith, thin like a sphenolith, or bulge discordantly like an akmolith or ethmolith. There are thus five elements that must be contributed towards a universal confederation of what Galerion Vanus called \"gray matter\" -- perception, evidence, essence, morality, and extraction."
