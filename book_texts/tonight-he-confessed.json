        "My handsome, pale lover! Tonight he confessed his true nature to me. I must admit I had my suspicions, but to hear him say the word sent shivers down my spine: Vampire!",
        "He seemed so small when he said the word, so frightened. So very much alone. My heart went out to him, and my love grew by leaps and bounds at that very moment.",
        "I took him in my arms and told him that I wasn't surprised. I had suspected the truth of his nature for quite some time, He seemed relieved. Painfully so. That's when he said the words I was hoping to hear. He asked me to join him for eternity.",
        "Sadly, I didn't think of my husband at all. I didn't even hesitate. I just said, yes, oh yes, forever yes!"
