        "It is with great sadness I report the deaths of so many of our brethren throughout Shadowfen. They fall like dead leaves in a burning forest as the invaders sear root and branch in their sacrilege.",
        "I do not know what the Dominion intends to do with the Hist sap it collects from our sacred trees, but I must warn you: your secluded hamlet may be next. The blood-trail of tapped Hist trees winds through Shadowfen and shows no sign of stopping. Red ants on a blood trail, they are. Make certain they do not consume you."
