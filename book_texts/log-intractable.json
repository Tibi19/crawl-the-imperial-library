        "Two weeks out and no sign of the so-called \"Renrijra Pirates\" or the Brotherhood of the Sakkr-al-Behr. It is my belief that while the Ra Gada have been successful in raiding along the coasts, they would not dare to sail upstream along the winding and unmapped rivers and waterways of Shadowfen.",
        "The Redguards are, essentially, a race of pirates, after all, pursuing only the easiest prey for the least risky benefits. Now that the Ebonheart Pact has mobilized naval vessels like the Intractable, there is little chance we will sight their sails within attack distance of any of our settlements.",
        "There appears to be a commotion on deck, so I will have to continue my log entry tomorrow. If those rig-monkeys have gotten into the rum again \u2014"
