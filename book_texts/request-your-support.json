        "To the Honorable Tidyn Arthalen,",
        "I want to first thank you for your service on the council that sat in judgment of my son. I will never forget your continued support of Meram and your insistence that death was too harsh a punishment for the crimes leveled against him.",
        "A great moment is coming, Sera Arthalen. The Tribunal has abused its authority. Almalexia has set herself up as our dictator. This is surely obvious to anyone with a clear heart and sharp mind. Her crimes cannot be allowed to continue. When the moment comes, I hope I can continue to rely on your support. Your support, and that of your preisthood and township, Selfora.",
        "Yours in mourning,\nMagistrix Vox"
