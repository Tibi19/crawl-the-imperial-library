        "To sleep, to dream, of Tamriel\nUnsullied by Anui-El.\nMan-ape, tell us.\nMaruhk, guide us.\nWhat child of Man could fail to be\nIn bliss if Nirn were Elven-free?\nMan-ape, tell us.\nMaruhk, guide us.\nWe willing march to heed your call,\nDevoted, pious, one and all.\nMan-ape, tell us.\nMaruhk, guide us.\nYour mandates we embrace.",
        "The Song-Never-Sung-at-Twilight",
        "That is not cruel which cures,\nO faith, charity, rigor.\nBy faith true heart endures,\nO hope, clarity, vigor.\nSeventy-Seven shall guide us,\nO praise, honor, and duty.\nAlessia lives inside us,\nAnd truth is one with beauty.",
        "The Forty-Third Praise-Song of Alessia",
        "My very inner organs swell\nWhen I am called upon to tell\nOf glory in expunging Taint\nIn honor of our blessed Saint\nAlessia, all praise to her\nWho freed Men from the hated Mer.\nThrice-bless'd are those who emulate\nHer sanctified, uplifting hate.\nThis, this, never that.\nThis, this, never that."
