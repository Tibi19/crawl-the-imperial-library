        "We have stalked our sister Daenella for years, reading the feathers and bones, for not even a witch of Beldama can escape the eye of the coven.",
        "Using the crow's sight, we found her upon an altar in the Reach. Time and age did little to fool us. She is the one who betrayed us to the knights.",
        "Such an act deserves a cruel death, but simply killing the traitor will not be enough for the ward mother's vengeance.",
        "We will corrupt her beloved's heart and return it tainted, damning his soul for eternity. She will know this as she dies upon the rock."
