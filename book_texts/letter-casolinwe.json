        "I had another unpleasant run-in with your friend, Mannimarco, yesterday. I don't know if I mentioned this before, but the Relicmaster put me in charge of overseeing vault deliveries. It is simple work\u2014just a matter of cataloging potentially explosive reagents, unstable relics, that sort of thing.",
        "Most of the acolytes have brought a parcel or two. Mannimarco, however, has brought dozens of unmarked crates, barrels of mysterious alchemical solvents, and so on. Given his seniority, I gave him a bit of latitude. But with the sheer volume of materials\u2014I had to say something, you know?",
        "I very politely asked him what was in his most recent delivery. He did not even look at me. He just said, \"Nothing you'd be interested in.\" I persisted\u2014gently, mind you! When I asked him a second time, he fixed those icy eyes on me and whispered something in the forgotten tongue of the Ublivey mystics. At the time, I thought he said \"If you ask again, you will know regret.\" But after some uncomfortable reflection, I think he might have said, \"If you ask again, you will know murder.\" It is an easy mistake to make\u2014the words are very similar. But I tell you, Cas, I do not think it was a mistake. He knows I am a linguist. I think he knew exactly what he was saying. Even now, my skin crawls at the thought. There is something very wrong with that mer, I know it. Please, be careful.",

        "PS\u2014His crates made a hollow, rattling sound as he carried them away. If I had to guess, I would say that they contained either dried wood or bones. I think you can guess which is more likely."
