        "Ah, Father. What would you think of your \"serious little boy\" now, I wonder? If Mother hadn't cremated your body when you died, maybe I'd wake you up and ask you.",

        "I can't believe my luck. I've stumbled across the ruins of a place called Wansalen.",
        "The unfortunates that built the place apparently didn't make it out alive.",
        "Now, though, they all walk the halls of Wansalen again. I wonder if their souls missed this place? Stubborn skeletons, they still won't answer when I talk to them!",
