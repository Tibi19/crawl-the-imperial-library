        "Six are the guardians, three fore and three incarnate\nHere to test your hero's ways, and show that you can learn it\nThe truest works we shall behold are those made by the silent",

        "The words you hear are based on meat\u2014don't let the sophists fool you\nFear not upon the walking way\u2014just let hysteria rule you\nIn their own world, the mad have laws\u2014but only if they're written\nThe wise can write them different rules\u2014for by the word they're smitten",
        "Use no words for apologies\u2014if you seek absolution\nAction is the walking way\u2014 and words are no solution\nThe wise avoid apology\u2014when ravers must be beaten\nSo sing not with the dusty tongue\u2014no word is true till eaten"
