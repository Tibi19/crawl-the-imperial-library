        "He never owned a castle,\nYet he always wore a crown,\nAnd he loved the skeevers and the cut-purses all the same,\nHe never lorded over but he always lorded true,\nWith a dozen trusty knights by his side,\nThey entered the Arena and won against all odds,\nAnd the legend of Dorzogg the Gutter-King spread far and wide"
