        "The sea before the serpent-prow did break.\nThe wind was trapped inside the black-cloth sails.\nThe pounding drum did mask the rower's wails,\nAnd demons of the sea swam in the wake.",
        "A dark rain fell as though a widow's veil,\nAlong with lightning-flash and thunder-peal,\nViscarne the butcher grasped his vessel's wheel\nThe villain of a thousand fractured tales.",
        "He did not spare his blade from those who kneel,\nOr from the young, the weak, the sick, the old.\nThe cruelty in his heart was often told,\nAnd those that faced his blade would never heal.",
        "The target of the grim fleet was Sunhold.\nAn Altmer prize long sought by Orgnum-king\u2014\nThe golden port once graced with gryphon wing,\nA victory that would not go untold.",
        "Viscarne sailed in, so our ancestors sing.\nBut found a harbor empty now, and still.\nNo ships to burn, no innocents to kill.\nNo one to feel the serpent's bitter sting.",
        "Then from the palace sitting on the hill,\nAn army dressed in gold came riding forth.\nA crushing wave of Altmer from the north,\nTo bring the sun's warmth to the Maormer chill.",
        "They killed Viscarne's second, third, and fourth,\nThe butcher's ships were burning in the bay.\nThe Maormer knew that he had lost the day,\nHis forces fallen having shown their lack of worth."
