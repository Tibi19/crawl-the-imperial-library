        "This moon-sugar is spectacular! We're going to make a bundle off this haul!",
        "I'm taking my share to Senchal. They're always desperate for decent moon-sugar over there and they have the gold to spare.",
        "I'll leave Haros's share at the old farm where we used to distill skooma. I have such fond and fuzzy memories of that place.",
        "I'll put Yasira's share at the river drop location north of the swamp, even though I hate that place. I can never get the mud out of my fur.",
        "Expect another note soon. You'll get your cut as soon as I have the gold in paw."
