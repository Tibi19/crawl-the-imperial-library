        "The trials serve as an offering of one's self to the Hist. For the Hist to trust the participant, the participant must first trust the Hist.",
        "The participant's mind, heart, and will are tested. Without a disciplined mind, one cannot comprehend the message of the Hist. Without a pure heart, one's purpose does not serve the will of the Hist. Without a warrior's will, one cannot safeguard the Hist for future generations.",
        "Be resolute, and stay moist."
