        "We are vampires of the Gray Host, so we have no need to open doors. Still, like my master, Exarch Tzinghalis, I have an unending thirst for knowledge. I must figure out this Dwarven door!",
        "No lock, no handle, no hinges.",
        "No levers, nothing obvious. How did the ancient Dwarves open it?",
        "The pillars, covered in gears. What is the significance of the panels on them? Four different images. Stars.",

        "The panels. The pattern doesn't repeat exactly, but the panels must be the answer.",
        "I think I figured it out. When you notice what's missing, the answer becomes clear!",
        "And with knowledge attained, I grow bored. On to the next great mystery!"
