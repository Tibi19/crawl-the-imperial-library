        "Cinosarion is obsessed with these pale Orcs. I just want to sleep, but I can hear him muttering over one of their corpses. Disgusting.",
        "Seems they are Orcs, after all, but they've been broken and changed. The Elf has a theory. He said the scarring suggests they were carved open and closed up, again and again. Some are missing limbs, or other parts. I don't want to know.",
