        "Herein lie beneath the soil,\nDestroyer's bones, no more to toil,\nBeneath the starry skies above,\nOr rend from us our hearthfelt love.\nFor many years the bones brought fear,\nTo little Elves, both far and near,\nBut when Destroyer took its rest,\nA seed we laid within its breast.\nIn time, we hope its roots grow deep,\nAnd 'neath the soil will come to keep,\nDestroyer's body here interred,\nFor many years, 'til spoken word,\nForgets his name and brings us peace,\nAs only time shall slay this beast."
