        "What takes the world in lightened sense\nCan also seek the outward gleam\nThey rob the all of essence to\nReport the nothing they have seen\nBone extrusions gash and grind\nIn moistened depths of smacking heat\nWhile tearing flesh from averse bone\nThe body whole prepares to eat\nA writhing mass of heaped appendage\nSlipping grasp the squirming slick\nExtend the reach to touch the face\nBurn the mind, reveal the quick\nCrushing razors, hollow shells\nThat snap, that twitch, that cinch and rend\nTo hold the subject, bodily,\n'Til mind blows soft and life meets end"
