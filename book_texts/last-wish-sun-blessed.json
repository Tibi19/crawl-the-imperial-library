        "Translated by Solis Aduro",
        "Though bathed in radiant glory\nSkin of gold and bark\nWe have fallen short of the yolk\nAnd now it is too late",
        "But light without darkness is blinding\nAnd the shadow always watches over us\nIt is here for us now, if we wish it\nThough the toil to pay our debt will be long",
        "We must, scales-of-gold\nWe must join with our brothers in the deep\nNo matter how much we lose",
        "Our roots are patient\nAnd we will rise again\nIn this world or the next"
