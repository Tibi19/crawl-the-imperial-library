        "We found a cave today. Looks to be an old, buried ruin. The place is very quiet. No evidence of creatures or beasts that we can see.",
        "The ankle I injured when we tried to loot Mzulft still hurts. While I rest here, Jase is going around the long way to see if he can open the gate from the other side. Wish he would hurry. I really hate how quiet this cave is.",
        "Maybe this time we'll find some treasure we can sell. I'd love to settle down somewhere. Maybe Riften. I'm tired of exploring holes in the ground and fighting monsters. Too much wear and tear on my aching bones."
