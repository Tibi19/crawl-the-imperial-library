        "Day 7 -",
        "I've arrived in S'ren-ja, this backwater Khajiiti village, to continue my research. The locals here have a minor crocodile infestation, and should provide the ideal base of operations for my experiments.",
        "Day 31 -",
        "Progress is slow, but I have almost achieved total mastery of the beasts. This morning I was able to force a mother crocodile to consume her own young! After she finished, the beast broke free from my control and I was forced to destroy it. I'm so close!",
        "Day 48 -",
        "My control is complete! The crocodiles of S'ren-ja are my puppets, and I am their master. I've experimented with having them slip into town and kill one or two nobodies. I'm sure they won't be missed. Now that I have mastered these beasts, though, I wonder if I could control something larger \u2026.",
        "Day 50",
        "I've decided. I shall summon and master a Daedra. I should start with a daedroth, it's only fitting. The uninformed often mistake the beautiful daedroth for a crocodile, don't they? I'm sure I'll have just as much success dominating the will of a daedroth as I did with these other beasts!"
