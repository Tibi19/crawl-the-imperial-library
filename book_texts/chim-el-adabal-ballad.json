        "When Akatosh slew Lorkhan,\nHe ripped his heart right out,\nHurled it across Tamriel,\nAnd the heart was heard to shout:\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nThe heart and soul of Men.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nProtect us till the end.\nThe laughing heart sprayed blood afar,\nA gout on Cyrod fell,\nAnd like a dart shot to its mark\nDown in an Ayleid Well.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nThe heart and soul of Men.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nProtect us till the end.\nMagicka fused the Lorkhan blood\nTo crystal red and strong\nThen Wild Elves cut and polished it down\nTo Chim-el Adabal.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nThe heart and soul of Men.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nProtect us till the end.\nWhen Elves lost Nirn to Man,\nAkatosh gave the stone\nTo Saint Alesh in token of\nHer right to sit the throne.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nThe heart and soul of Men.\nRed Diamond! Red Diamond!\nProtect us till the end."
