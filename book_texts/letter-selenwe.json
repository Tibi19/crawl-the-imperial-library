        "Dear Selenwe,",
        "I hope all is well, my dear. In reference to your query, no, I'm afraid Lauriel has not improved. She misses you terribly, but says very little about it. How I long to hear her beautiful voice again! Do you remember the autumn hymn she used to sing each morning? I still hear her hum it from time to time, but it's a mournful rendition to be sure.",
        "She's made a new friend\u2014an artificer from Sunhold. I tell you, daughter, something about him puts me ill-at-ease. He rarely speaks and dresses in a manner most unbecoming. Then there's the smell. A musty, acrid scent follows him wherever he goes. The two of them spend hours in the catacombs, sharpening their spellcraft. I asked her why she would train in such a dour place, but she refused to answer.",
        "A few days ago, I worked up the nerve to forbid Lauriel from seeing this vagabond again, but called off at the last moment. I feel her drifting further away from me with each passing day. If I rob her of this new friend, she may turn her back on us completely.",
        "You know her better than anyone. What can I do? I await your reply with great anxiety.",
        "Your loving mother,\nOhadil"
