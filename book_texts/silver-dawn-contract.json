        "Thank you so much for accepting this sacred duty on behalf of your respected order. The Silver Dawn has often worked with the priests of the Divines to rid our world of the foul curse of lycanthropy, and we are anxious to employ your services once again.",
        "The target this time is a young Nord woman who answers to the name of Hildegard. She wears a flower in her hair and often visits the Great Chapel of Dibella in Anvil. Don't let appearances deceive you, however. Beneath her unimposing frame beats the heart of a monster.",
        "On her next visit to the chapel, I shall convince her to return to the wilderness of Skyrim that gave birth to her curse. Track her and dispatch her. Just do what you do best and a generous donation shall be made to your order.",
