        "Dearest Rultari,",
        "This is my third letter since your last correspondence. I am concerned for your wellbeing. What your father is doing sounds macabre and, frankly, dangerous. It would be foolish enough to take these afflicted travelers into your own home, but dwelling down in the family crypts with these diseased people is downright ghoulish. What would the Divine Prosecution think of such disturbing behavior? If my brother will not see reason, I insist you take leave of Corgrad and stay with us until he has come to his senses, your brother as well if he may be convinced. At the very least, send word that you are safe and sound.",
