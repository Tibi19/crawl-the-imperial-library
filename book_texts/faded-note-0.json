        "I am\u2014was\u2014Sanessalmo's adjutant. May my loyalty be rewarded in another life.",
        "I worked for decades with the master. When he was\u2014I thought\u2014unjustly removed from the Queen's Court, I stood with him. No one could judge him for what happened to his wife, I thought. The public eye can be cruel. But the man I work for now bears little resemblance to that man. He has broken.",
        "I have performed tasks in these strange landscapes of the mind that would make most moral men shiver. I have supported rituals so heinous that the line between death and life is blurred. I mourn for the Sanessalmo I knew: witty conversationalist, loyal employer, loving husband.",
        "The monster he has become. Is unrecognizable. I write these words staring at a wall of ice. Certain to be the last thing I see.",
        "Should someone find ths letter, I hope they do better by Sanessalmo than I."
