        "A mighty lord deserves a mighty offering\nBut he who fell on this spot asked to be remembered humbly\nWe who served at his hand, however, do not want his brilliance to be forgotten\nThus, to honor him, one needs only to look to the simple, glowing fungus on these cave walls\nFor no matter how mighty or humble one may be in life \nWe all return to the same ground from which this mushroom blooms",
