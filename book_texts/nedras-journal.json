        "There's nothing left for me here. Sister and I have tried so hard to make a life, but <<1>> is getting sicker by the day. No one is willing to hire a \"cannibal Elf\" from the southern jungles. Damned idiots, everywhere. Giants with malformed ears and breath that stinks of cabbage.",
        "I keep promising <<1>> that it'll get better. That we'll be able to afford balm for her illness. I'm a liar. It's not going to get better.",
        "I have to leave her here in Northpoint, leave her to find the gold for her balm. I hate to do it. But by the Green I will not let my sister down!",
        "- - - - - - - -\nI've only been with the Bitterhand a few days, but I've already earned more gold than I've seen in three months. I sent most of it back to <<1>> in Northpoint. Kept just enough to buy a decent blade.",
        "I can't tell her how I came by the gold. All the blood on my hands would sicken her. What I've become would sicken her. But then, she was already sick. What she doesn't know won't hurt her.",
        "- - - - - - - -\nThere are more soldiers out hunting for the Bitterhands every day. We barely escaped that last patrol. I'm going to die. I know it. I can tell the way the others look at me, they know I don't have the training, the stomach for this.",
        "I love her so much. I wish I could have seen her again. I wish it didn't have to be this way. However I end up in the ground, I'll die knowing I took care of my family. My <<1>>."
