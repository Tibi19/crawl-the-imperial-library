        "Sing, O Stars, the glory that dwells in the hearts of all people. Beneath Hosiven's stone and the long-quenched pyre of Sarhedil, let their labors find purpose and glory. Know O pilgrim, the virtues of the Stars, for all great deeds cry for blessing. Let the Stars guide the righteous through the Gray Passage, through the caves of Upper Craglorn, to find the prayer markers and their commands.",
        "Heed the Stars, O pilgrim, and undertake their quest. Seek their six virtues, hewn into stone. Bear each command with a noble heart and return with the utmost speed. For only the swift and the just shall receive celestial favor."
