        "The others at the Fishery have never understood my appreciation of mudcrabs, and our recent battle has only increased my respect for these lovely clawed creatures.

I plan to spend my every waking hour working to save up for it. I'll need a large bundle of wood, nails, iron fittings for the stall doors, and a lock to keep my earnings safe.",
