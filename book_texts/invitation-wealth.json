        "Many have spoken of the Ebonheart Pact as a force for peace between our peoples. A force for war against the Aldmeri Dominion, the Daggerfall Covenant, and other such upstart powers.",
        "Today, I ask you to think of the Ebonheart Pact as a force for wealth!",
        "Until now, Black Marsh has remained largely closed to trade, other than that in Argonian slaves. The inhabitants have never been willing to deal with their enemies. However, Shadowfen is slightly more developed than the rest of the Marsh, and it is Shadowfen that is the gateway to riches!",
        "For only a small commission, I can take your goods to Shadowfen and sell them to the Argonians. They are a people with relatively few fine goods, yet they are no duller or less covetous than your Dunmeri customers.",
        "The Argonians will be lining up for our silks and steels. The potential demand is almost impossible to calculate.",
        "Give me your goods today, and I will bring you gold tomorrow!"
