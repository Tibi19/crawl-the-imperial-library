        "When Summerset, o Summerset, our fair and pretty land,\nIs threatened from beyond the clear and shining sea,\nThe Welkynar, our Gryphon Knights, take wing and make a stand,\nWith courage, strength, and bravery, they keep the Altmer free!",
        "Charge, o Gryphon Knights,\nFly on and fight our foes!\nCharge, o Welkynar,\nTake wing with swords and bows!",
        "From Alinor to Shimmerene and every point between,\nThe Welkynar ride the winds and defend our gleaming isle,\nhether commoner, noble, merchant, or queen,\nThe Gryphon Knights protect us all, always with a smile!",
        "Charge, o Gryphon Knights,\nFly on and fight our foes!\nCharge, o Welkynar,\nTake wing with swords and bows!"
