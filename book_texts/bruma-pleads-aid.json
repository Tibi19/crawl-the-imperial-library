        "Bruma, as you know, lies south of Fort Dragonclaw. While the fort is contested ground, invading alliance troops have ignored Bruma. Ordinarily, I would be grateful for this. But not now.",
        "Dremora have killed or captured most of the folk here. A Dark Anchor brings more horrors into Bruma daily. Without help, I believe we will soon be overrun.",
        "I have appealed to Grand Warlord Dortene of the Daggerfall Covenant as well. Whichever alliance sends troops to our aid first will have our everlasting gratitude and a vital supply base.",
