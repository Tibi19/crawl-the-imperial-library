        "Bright Moons, my love! J'zuruk gathered the troupe last night and pled our case. Nuzulaza and Hanilar yowled like ja'khajiit, but in the end, our friends decided your freedom was more important than a new wagon. It will take some time to gather the coin, but this one knows she will see you soon. Seek out the ropefish, Khartag. He captains the vessel that will bring you home to me.",
