        "Sing, O muse, of glorious Balamath,\nWhose tireless song lilts then booms,\nEbbing like thunder through panes of glass.\nGreat winds wake,\n'Neath gnarled bough and crumbled stone,\nThe sighs of long dead scholar-kings,\nBreathing still through creaking bones.\nHere the columns lurk unburdened,\nWelkynds strain against a potent gloom.\nArches stand like arrows drawn,\nThe scholar's mark, the endless sky,\nIn whose depths the greatest storms\nRoar, snort, bluster,\nLike great gray beasts\nWaiting, yearning to be tamed.\nIn this place we find the power,\nA hidden canyon of ancient stone\nCradles, shelters, and conceals,\nThe forgotten bellows of old Aldmeris.",
