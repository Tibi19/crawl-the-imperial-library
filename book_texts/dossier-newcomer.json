        "This newcomer's made quite a splash. No deep connections in the region that we're aware of, but they've linked up with Famia. Blackguards will want to keep a close eye on this one.",
        "The Newcomer: traveling adventurer\u2014recent addition to Cyrodilic Collections' employment rolls. The warrior displays a high degree of competence in both fighting and dungeoneering. Initial reports indicate they rescued or otherwise ferried Famia's crew through the Ixtaxh Xanmeer soon after arriving in Murkmire.",
        "We're not sure how much this one knows yet, but it stands to reason that Famia would share at least a few of her secrets with them.",
        "Recommended abduction method: attack in force. This will take a very concerted effort\u2014no less than twenty fighters recommended. Even that might not be enough. Engage at your own risk."
