        "The King is furious. Construction of our magnificent temple was completed several months ago. At that time we dispatched an emmisary to the city of Delodiil. The invitation to view our seat of power was extended with an open hand. A chance for the heretics to make a pilgrimage and, at last, bow to the Master.",
        "Today the response arrived from the so-called King of Delodiil, condescendingly dismissing our invitation. He called our temple \"pitiful\" and mocked our craftsmen and our Master!",
        "This cannot be borne! Father has entered the heart of the temple, and even from here I can hear his rage as he shouts to the Master for aid to wipe this humiliation away.",
        "Father is furious, but I am filled with joy. This affront must end in war. This insult must end in death.\nSo much death!"
