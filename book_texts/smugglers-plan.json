I'd bet moon sugar to sea salt no one's been down there in ages. If you can find out where the sewer opens up inside Haven, you've got a surefire way inside.",
        "Explore the area thoroughly. I don't expect you'll see any guards down there, but who knows what's moved in during the years of abandonment?

Trader I got them from assured me they hate their smell. You'll be safe enough.",
