        "You will rotate duty between scouting and watching over the mammoths. The great beasts must be kept secure at all times. They become more agitated with every hour we keep them confined, and that's making them dangerous.",
        "One of the beasts broke free last night and trampled its guards to death. It then caused immense amounts of damage to the fort. I hate to think what three or four of the beasts could do if they got loose at the same time.",
        "Your orders are to make sure that doesn't happen on your watch. If it does, make sure the mammoth tramples you. So I don't have to.",
