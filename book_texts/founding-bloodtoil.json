        "We spent the winter in Falinesti, only to return and find our holy site overrun by Drublog squatters claiming it as their own. The faithful of Z'en returned with an overwhelming force of rangers and removed the vile beasts.",
        "Our forefathers' village, renamed Bloodtoil, has been reclaimed. But the shrine is unclean, filled with relics to Mauloch. A new shrine to Z'en will be dedicated shortly.",
        "The Orcs threatened to return, but the faithful of Z'en do not fear their petty threats. Z'en ensures debts are paid in kind."
