        "I have selected well by choosing this mighty wamasu eggbearer for our needs. Her brood will provide exactly the predatory traits we require for the next stage of the alchemical process. When combined with the traits provided by the powerful scorpion matron and the flawless crocodile matriarch, the material from the wamasu will increase the power of the mantikora tenfold!",
        "I wonder if I can breed the charged current that vibrates through the wamasu into the mantikora? If I can do that, the creature will be even more wondrous to behold. I've collected the first of the eggbearer's eggs. The material within each shell should infuse the spawning pools with traits that will easily be passed on to our new creature.",
        "When the Serpent sees all that I have accomplished, I'm sure my position within the Scaled Court will grow in stature as the mantikoras grow within the spawning pools. I can't wait to meet our creation!",
