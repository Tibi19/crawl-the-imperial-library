        "The work of hunting vampires is best reserved for the mentally unstable. Average people, if they try to pursue a vampire, will more likely end up being prey than predator.",
        "It's not that the average person is not strong enough or cunning enough (although that is often the case). It's that they are not single-minded enough.",
        "The vampire does not know family, or love, or hope. It only knows the desire to feed. So must the vampire hunter mimic his prey. He must abandon all love, all hope, all memory of family or friends. Anything that might distract his mind from the goal at hand must be sloughed off like dead skin.",
        "The vampire hunter must become a predator's predator, unknown and unknowable. Anything short of that and he will quickly become food for his quarry\u2014or worse, he will be transformed into the very monster he seeks to destroy."
