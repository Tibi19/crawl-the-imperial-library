        "And when the Snow Prince fell to ground,\nThe Ice Elves divided above and below.\nNow vanquished and brutally bound,\nOne moment had shattered all they did know.",
        "The once cool wind on their skin,\nNow replaced with the heat of the flame.\nAnd a pride once felt deep within,\nForgotten along with their name.",
        "Torn from their home of ice and frost,\nThrown into the pitch black dread of night.\nLiving in fear as their minds become lost,\nAs their eyes begin dimming the light.",
        "Chained and enslaved,\nWhat once was light turned to blackness.\nAlone and betrayed,\nSinking deeper into madness."
