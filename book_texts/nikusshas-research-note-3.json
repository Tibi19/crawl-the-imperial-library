        "How could I let this happen?",
        "I was so sure that I would be able to contain this plague, but even with our best efforts it spread rapidly. With so much at stake, I began to rush with my research. After all, what good is a cure when there are none left to heal?",
        "But through my studies, I did something horrible. The oasis, once a place of purity and healing, has been tainted by this sickness as well. I do not know if it is the presence of so many bodies, or merely the aura of death, but the oasis has changed. Rapidly.",
        "Corpses have begun to spring to life and a miasma fills the cavern. I doubt any will survive past this day. I just want to say I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen. I was just trying to save the town I had grown to love. To save the people who took in a lonely traveler, and placed so much trust in me.",
        "I'm sorry."
