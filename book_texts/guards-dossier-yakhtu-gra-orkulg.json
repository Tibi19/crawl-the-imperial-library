        "Yakhtu gra-Orkulg was a former blacksmith at the Stash 'N Slash in the Imperial City, a shop she inherited from her father. She was contacted by the Crimson Dirks and recruited to forge arms for the bandits as well as launder sacked goods through her shop. When the Imperial City guard issued a warrant for her arrest, she fled the city with another member of the bandit gang.",
        "",
        "Operational Notes:",
        "Yakhtu was originally thought to have fled to High Rock and taken refuge in an Orc Stronghold. However, according to our informant, she actually traveled with another agent to Skyrim. Reports of unusually well made weapons and armor being peddled out of Embershard Mine may be related. This information should be forwarded to Commander Caius in Whiterun as the mine falls under his jurisdiction."
