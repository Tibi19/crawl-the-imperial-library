        "I guess being Bosmer really does give me a way with animals! This little fox wandered up to me today, bold as brass, and started begging for treats. I didn't have anything on me at the time but a sweet roll, but it seemed to like that well enough. I wonder if this gift with animals works on horses - it would make stealing them dead easy.",

        "The furry nuisance won't leave me alone! It's been following me everywhere, even down into the sewers. At least it's quiet enough that it won't alert the guards...",

        "The fox has a real nose for sniffing out valuables. Just this morning she dug a silver locket out of the mud - I never would have seen it if she hadn't started pawing at the ground. She must be attracted to shiny things. Can't say I blame her, really.",

        "Finding Sweet Roll has turned out to be the best stroke of luck I've had in a while. She's got better eyes and instincts than any thief I've ever met, including Vex. I can't remember the last time my coin purse was this heavy - I'm starting to jingle like a battalion of Imperials when I walk.",

        "I think I'll try out this animal-taming thing on the wolves outside of town. Some of the other thieves have been eyeing me recently; they would think twice about jumping me if I had a wolf at my heels."
