        "For the edification and admonition of all that should pass through this  hall. Know that this is one of the five great Anchors that moor the  Battlespire in its place and retain it in the life-flood of sustaining  Mana, without which there is no light, no life, no Being.",
        "In their o'er-reaching wisdom, the Powers have required me, against my  every protest and complaint, to affix to it a dreadful device, which you  see before you, whose purpose is to sunder and divide this anchor and  imperil the Spire and all who inhabit it.",
        "Never divide the Anchor. It is the rock on which all our lives are  founded. All Anchors must be conjoined to assure the safety and  stability of the Spire. Above all, never allow them all to be unloosed.  Sure destruction shall follow, as the Battlespire departs the flux that  keeps all sides of nature in unity. Now avaunt, and quit this chamber,  lest the imp of temptation, or some unhappy humour overcome you, and  lead you onto the path of certain annihilation.",
        "C.V."
