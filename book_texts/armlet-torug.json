        "\"King Torug\", founder of the original city of Orsinium, possessed a powerful relic known as the Armlet of Torug. According to legend, the armlet is a magical bracelet encrusted with gems. With its power, Torug was able to tame the savage wilderness of Wrothgar and establish the first city of Orsinium.",
        "Ancient text fragments describe the armlet, Torug's shrine, and something called \"Sorrow's Kiss.\" Armed only with these hints\", the famed explorer Lady Clarisse Laurent agreed to lead an expedition to the summit to find and retrieve the relic on behalf of the House of Orsimer Glories.",
        "As with all items of historic significance, please remember not to touch anything in the museum."
