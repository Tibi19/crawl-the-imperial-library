        "While our experiments at Fort Grief have proven that the Riven Cataclyst works and produces viable Incarnates, the process remains slow and difficult. Sister Celdina has made it clear that creating one Incarnate at a time\u2014and failing outright in all too many attempts\u2014is unacceptable.

Under my direction, our mages have collaborated in the construction of a one-quarter scale model of what we call the Improved Cataclyst. The model has performed well in trials so far.",
