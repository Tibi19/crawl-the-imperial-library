        "In old Ra Gada days\nWhen Forebears came ashore\nAmong them were sword-singers\nAccording to the lore\nAt fore were Yaghoub's Thirteen\nNoble Ansei all\nOne there was named Navid\nThis song is of his fall\nNavid loved Sayeedeh\nSayeedeh loved him not\nHer heart was pledged to Ihlqub\nThe Thirteen's finest shot\nAs Ihlqub plied his bow\nIn practice on the beach\nNavid approached with empty hands\nUntil he was in reach\nWhile Ihlqub faced the target\nNavid called up his shehai\nSlew his love's love with sacred sword\nAnd watched his rival die\nBack to Yaghoub's beachhead\nWent into his tent\nFell for shame on his own sword\nDishonor thus was spent"
