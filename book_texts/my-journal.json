        "4th First Seed\nBleakrock is as cold as they told us it would be. I can't believe people live here. I'll steal their secrets as quickly as I can. Then I'll return to the warmth of the woods.",
        "5th First Seed\nWe have most of the information we need. The queen will be pleased. We'll leave tomorrow. I can't wait to thaw out my toes.",
        "???\nI've been unconscious. How long was I out? The last thing I remember was the cave-in. Was it the Pact? Did they find us? Everyone else is dead, even Oriell. He fell in battle. I won't leave him to rot.",
        "???\nEver since the cave-in, magic gives me a headache. I can't dig out. There's too much rock. The only thing to eat is roots. What am I going to do?",
        "???\nThe roots were poisonous. Worse, I think they're hallucinogenic. I'm seeing my dead friends. Arawe. Tarak. Even Oriell. What's happened to my mind?",
        "Ice Day\nThe squirrels are the problem. They caused the cave-in. They're in league with the shiny stones.\nI'll get them.",
        "Melting Day\nI found Arawe! A greedy squirrel had her. She turned into a candelabra.\nThe squirrel's gone now, and she's back with me. I missed her. There's so many more to collect!",
        "Culling Day\nGreedy squirrels tried to take my friends. I made them into icicles."
