        "Here lies a hero as stubborn and possessive in death as he was in life. Let no one disturb Oozrul's remains, nor steal his precious helm, lest they suffer his eternal curse. Whosoever would possess the helm shall be reviled by the Orsimer and shall be driven from their lands, never to return."
