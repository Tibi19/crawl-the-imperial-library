        "Eyes of polished amber, hair swept like a comet's tail\nSoul alight with love and joy 'neath pregnant golden sails",
        "My star-eyed bride of Alinor\nLost in storm and spray\nMy star-eyed bride of Alinor\nThat cruel fate took away",
        "White swan feathers fluttered from her ivory bridal gown\nAnd unsung vows slipped from her lips, eager to be found",
        "My star-eyed bride of Alinor\nGone beneath the waves\nMy star-eyed bride of Alinor\nThe sea became her grave",
        "The clouds they gathered overhead, ripping sail from mast\nThe hull creaked like a coffin's hinge as the captain yelled 'hold fast!'",
        "My star-eyed bride of Alinor\nShe never made it home\nMy star-eyed bride of Alinor\nDrowned in brine and foam",
        "The lightning crashed upon the sea, the wind howled with the swells\nI strained to reach her glistening hand, but into the depths she fell",
        "My star-eyed bride of Alinor\nWhose last words were my name\nMy star-eyed bride of Alinor\nI still weep from the shame",
        "Upon the beach I wander still, to gaze out at the sea\nHoping to see her shining face smiling back at me",
        "My star-eyed bride of Alinor\nLost in storm and spray\nMy star-eyed bride of Alinor\nThat cruel fate took away"
