        "Excerpt from The Book of the Warrior God: 4:22\u2014The Rage of Usunok",
        "He hunted not for food or sport. He hunted not for the thrill of the kill. No, he hunted to prove his strength. The beast before him rose, taller than the trees. Usunok, armed only with his fists and the blessing of his god Trinimac, charged forward to deliver a single blow. For with Trinimac's blessing upon him, one blow was all he would need. In an instant, it was over. No amount of scales or fat or muscle could stop the force of Usunok's rage striking its target. The beast fell with hardly a cry or a whimper. Usunok did not celebrate. He did not cheer. He simply went hunting for his next challenge."
