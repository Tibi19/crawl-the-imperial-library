        "No one true path leads to mastery of the Vrin-Thak style. No specific steps make you an adept or a master. Instead, reflect upon these things and discover your own path.",
        "The sword is your soul. The soul is your sword.",
        "[Scrawled in angry strokes: \"Ziss this gaking gak! May Valami cut open her soul with her own sword! What does this even mean?\"]",
        "Meditate on these words. What do they mean to you?",
        "[More angry strokes: \"They mean you're a blazing incompetent who can't even train your students. That's what they gaking mean!]",
        "Do they suggest a path? No, probably not.",
        "[Jagged strokes in large letters: \"YOU DON'T SAY?\"]",
        "Any who train in the ways of the Vrin-Thak spend hours learning basic forms before being handed a weapon. Yet, if the soul is your sword, and your sword is your soul, does that not mean masters are stunting the growths of their students from the start? I say no.",
        "[In smaller script: \"Done. This one is done with this. This one is not even going to...\"]",
        "[This scroll ends abruptly, as if the one annotating it tore off everything under the last note.]"
