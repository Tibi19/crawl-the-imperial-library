        "Another night with no bites on my neck. We can call that a victory, I guess. My Uncle Hofnar used to spin yarns about sleeping with one eye open in his seafaring days\u2014to keep a lookout for squalls. I've been trying to outdo him by sleeping with both eyes open. Hasn't worked.",
        "Ballista's dry. Unless we start firing pots and pans out of it, I think it's just expensive firewood now. Wasn't all that useful anyway. I glanced over the wall yesterday and saw one of those damned Giants swinging one of the bolts like a club. Just what they need. More clubs.",
        "I don't know how much more of this we can take. I hear those damned vampires scratching at the walls all night. Whispering to us\u2014trying to coax us out with their black magic. I'm deaf in one ear, so it only bothers me half as much as the others. But I had to drag Rudhild off the parapet before she jumped headfirst into a pack of those bloodsuckers. Ogvar tied her up and splashed water on her face. She's still wailing and babbling though. Everyone says it's the black magic talking, but I'm not so sure. I feel like we're all just a few nights away from screaming along with her."
