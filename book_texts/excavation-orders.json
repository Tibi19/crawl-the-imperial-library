        "Take great pains in your excavations. Let no reckless hand mar the works trapped beneath the ash and earth. We have waited so long to be here. Do not squander our great achievement in your zeal.",
        "When you heft the relics of this place, do you not feel the weight of their significance in every fiber of your being? Do you feel their gravity pulling you deeper into the earth so that you might hold them? Their place in the world is not beneath our feet, but in the hands of their rightful heirs.",
        "Dig with purpose. Dig with care."
