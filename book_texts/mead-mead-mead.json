        "Mead, mead, mead!\nIt's what a body needs!\nIt makes us strong and wise and brave,\nThere's nothing better, it's what we crave!",
        "Mead, mead, mead!\nI drink it morning, noon, and eve.\nI like it spiced and sweet and powerful,\nI'll soon be drunk and that's quite probable,\nMead, mead, mead!"
