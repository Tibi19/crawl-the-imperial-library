        "\u2014certain someone is watching me. I'd bet a bucket of gold that it's one of those damned Naga. They nearly got me at the Tsona-Geeva ruins, but I grew up in the alleys of Sentinel. These lizards can't catch me!",
        "I just wish I hadn't left my damned backpack behind! Famia's going to give me those sad puppy-dog-eyes when I tell her I lost the vakka stone. Not looking forward to that. Luckily, it seems like Dinia left her bag here. That's something, at least.",
        "Anyway, that's enough excitement for one day. I'll spend the night here in the hut and head back to Lilmoth in the morning. Some days I really hate this place!"
