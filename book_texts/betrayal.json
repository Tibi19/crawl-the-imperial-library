        "This place I built on solid rock,\nIt breaks, crumbles away,\nDestroyed and shaken to the core,\nBetrayed by Alanwe\nMy blindness was my love for her,\nThough any fool could weigh,\nHer will was weak, her lust unbound,\nThat strumpet, Alanwe\nMy heart betrayed, I took her soul,\nCracked it with vicious fray,\nEternal now will be her pain,\n'Tis the fate of Alanwe"
