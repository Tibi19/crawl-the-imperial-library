        "Sanarel the Great reigned as Champion for nearly two centuries. His command of shield and blade were unmatched and his victories were swift and merciless. It was said that he carried a magical shield enchanted by Trinimac himself. This artifact had the power to blind his opponents, rendering them defenseless against his initial attacks. As his legend and his arrogance grew, favor with his patron diety waned, leading to his eventual defeat at the hand of the Lava Queen.",
