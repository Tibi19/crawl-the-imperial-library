        "Many years ago, when I was a young Elf, I came across a book in the ancient Ayleid language that described a magnificent fortress deep within Valenwood. Ever since discovering this book, I have been captivated by the idea of this place.",
        "Unfortunately, the book was lost to me under mysterious circumstances before I was able to commit my translation to writing. But I have transcribed from memory what I can recall of that mesmerizing description.",
        "\"The great fortress of Carac Dena stood for centuries, held by a hundred Ayleid who had bled into the stone at its creation. The fortress rested high above the coast of Valenwood, a great stone monument and a bulwark against all enemies.",
        "\"Because of its greatness, it became a wayrest for travelers, a vault for great treasures, and a vast library. It was even said that one could hear singing when one approached the fortress.",
        "\"\u2026 when the great horde* laid siege to the gates, the fortress of Carac Dena stood firm for a hundred years, until the great force beneath threatened to overwhelm the gates. That is when the commander gathered the hundred original soldiers and convened a meeting. The fateful decision was made. One by one the soldiers bled on the stones and brought the great fortress crashing to the ground, destroying the enemy host beneath it.\"",
        "* The text is unclear as to the nature of this horde, and the word used is unfamiliar to me, but resembles the word for \"army.\"",
        "I have dedicated my life to finding the location of this great fortress. I am now certain that it must have been swallowed by the land after it fell. And indeed, I believe I have at last narrowed down the location. It only remains for me to gather a fitting group of Wood Elf guides and venture to the spot \u2026."
