        "I've been here two weeks, and things are progressing nicely. I'm a lot stronger than I was, mostly due to the heavy lifting and sparring we do. I hurt a lot, but it's no worse than being beaten up at home.",
        "The Pack Leaders never seem to stop preaching. They're always talking about \"being like the wolf\" and how if we focus, we'll \"transcend our weakness.\" They're more like a cult than I thought, but I think I've found a home here.",
        "There's one pretty young thing \u2026 Naraa. She seems to like the look of me. We'll have to see what she thinks after the sparring session next week!"
