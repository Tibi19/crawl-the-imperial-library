        "The Bosmeri and Khajiiti warparties clashed in the fields near Thormar. The battle lasted an entire day but in the end the Bosmer were victorious, leaving Khajiiti corpses scattered about the field. The Khajiiti leader, a powerful mage named Yenamu Frost-Fist, was the last to fall. She and the last of the the Khajiit held for hours, as she ripped walls of ice from the ground to thwart attack after attack. One by one, the last of the defenders fell until Yenamu stood alone. Finally a single arrow, shot by an unknown Bosmer, struck her through the eye and the battle was won.",
