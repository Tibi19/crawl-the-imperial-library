        "Hrormir\nSon of Hrorgar\nSummoned to the Court of Vjindak,\nSon of Vjinmore, King of Evensnow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Mighty caster of magic,\nI charge thee to go to Aelfendor,\nFor its hoary Warriors do threaten my Land\nAnd bring forth their cousin Demons\nTo terrify my People.\"\nHrormir\nSon of Hrorgar\nHeard the Words of Vjindak Evensnow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"By Icestaff,\nSurely I would help thee\nBut I have already a Quest to drink\nTwelve Flagons of Mead in one Hour,\nAnd then to bed four Wenches,\nTwice each.\nSo I must with grace decline.\"\nThe King he did not smile\nAt Hrormir and his jolly Spirit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"By thine Honor\nMust thou aidest my Cause\nFor must thou takest up the Sword\nOf thy Companion Darfang\nWho took the Quest and failed.\"\nHrormir laughed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Now I know thou jest.\nMy boon Mate Darfang wouldst not fail.\nThere be no finer Bladesman.\nIf thou chargest him, he wouldst not fall.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I did not say he fell.\nHe joined the Dark Kings of Aelfendor\nAnd by doing so dishonored\nHimself and thee, his Friend.\"",
        "Hrormir could not believe the Words,    And yet, he knew Eversnow\nDidst not lie.\nSo for twenty Days and three rodeth he\nTo the Land of Night, the Kingdom of Fear,\nWhere the Peasants ever carried Candles\nKnowing what Evil awaiteth them\nShould they stray beyond the Glow.\nThe Sovereigncy of three Dark Kings:\nAelfendor.\nThere, Torch in Hand, didst Hrormir\nPass through haunted Countryside\nAnd frightened Villages,\nAnd through the black Gates\nOf the blacker Castle of Aelfendor.\nThe three Dark Kings didst sneer\nAt the sight of mighty Hrormir\nAnd summoned they their Champion\nDarfang the Blade.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"My boon Companion!\"\nHrormir called in the Hall of Night.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I dare not trust my Eyes,\nFor then I wouldst believe\nThat thou hast joined with Evil,\nAnd turned thy Way from Honor\nAnd Brotherhood!\"",
        "\"Hrormir!\"    Darfang the Blade didst cry.\n\"If thou dost not go now,\nOne of us must die, for I hate thee!\"\nBut Hrormir was battle ready,\nAnd in the echoing Halls of Night\nThe Blade of Darfang\nAnd the Staff of Hrormir\nDidst strike again and yet again.\nMighty Warriors and Mages both,\nThe boon Companions now Foes,\nShook Mundus with their War.\nThey might have fought for a Year\nIf there were Sun in Aelfendor\nTo mark Time,\nAnd either Hrormir or Darfang\nMay verily have won.\nBut Hrormir saweth through the Dark\nThe Tears in the Eyes of his former Friend,\nAnd then he saweth the Shadow of Darfang\nWert not his own.\nAnd so with Icestaff, he did strike\nNot Darfang, but his Shadow, which cried.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Hold, Mortal Man!\"",
        "The Shadow becameth the Hag,    Bent and twisted, in her Cloak and Hood.\nFrom her faceless Shadows, she hissed.\n\"Mortal Man called Hrormir\nThe Soul of thy boon Companion\nIs my Plaything,\nBut I will take thine in trade,\nFor though ye both have strong Arms,\nThou hast the more clever Mind\nWhich my Sons the Dark Kings need\nFor a Champion of Aelfendor.\"\nHrormir the brave didst not take a Breath\nOr pause before he boldly said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Shadowy Hag, release Darfang,\nAnd thou mayst use me as thou will.\"\nThe Hag didst laugh and freed Darfang.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"To save thine Honor this thou hast done,\nBut now thou must be without Honor\nMortal Man, as the Champion\nOf the Dark Kings, my Heirs of Gray Maybe,\nThou must help them divide Aelfendor,\nAnd love me,\nThy Shadowy Hag and thy Mistress well.\"",
        "For his loss of Honor,    And his dear Friend's Sacrifice,\nNoble Darfang prepared to take his Dagger\nAnd plunge it in his good Heart,\nBut Hrormir stayed his Brother's Hand and whispered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"No, boon Companion,\nWait for me at the Village Banquet Hall.\"\nAnd then did Darfang the Blade leave the Castle\nWhile Hrormir took the withered Claw\nOf the Hag, and pressed it to his Lips.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Shadowy Hag, to thee I pledge\nTo only honor thy black Words\nTo turn my back on Truth\nTo aid thy Dark Kings' Ambition\nTo divide their Inheritance fairly\nTo love thee\nTo think thee beautiful.\"\nThen to the Chamber in the Heart of Night\nHrormir and the Hag did retire\nKissed he there her wrinkled Lips\nAnd her wrinkled, sagging Breasts,\nFor ten Days and Nights and three did Hrormir\nAnd his Icestaff\nBattle thus.",
        "Then Sweet Kynareth blew honeyed Winds    O'er the Hills and Forest Glens of Aelfendor,\nAnd the Caress of warm blooded Dibella \nCoaxed the Blossoms to wanton Display\nSo that Aelfendor became a Garden\nOf all the Senses.\nThe frightened Servants of the Dark Kings\nWoke to find there was naught to fear\nAnd through the once dark Streets of the Village\nCame the Cries of Celebration.\nIn the Banquet Hall of the Village\nHrormir and his boon Companion Darfang\nEmbraced and drank of rich Mead.\nThe Shadowy Hag too was smiling,\nSleeping still in her soft Bed,\nUntil the morning Sun touched her naked Face\nAnd she awoke, and saw All,\nAnd knew All saw her.\nAnd she cried out:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Mortal Man!\"",
        "Night fell fast upon the Land    As the Hag flew into the Banquet Hall\nCasting blackest Darkness in her Wake\nBut all the Celebrants still could see\nHer Anger\nIn her monstrous Face\nAnd they shook with Fear.\nThe Hag had said the Kingdom was\nTo be divided among her Heirs.\nBut Aelfendor had been kept whole\nWhile her Children divided,\nDrawn and quartered.\nHrormir was mightily amused.\nHe swallowed his Laughter\nIn his Mead,\nFor none should laugh outright\nAt the Daedra Lord Nocturnal.\nWithout her gray Cowl of shadowed Night,\nHer hideous Face forced the Moons\nTo hide themselves.\nHrormir the mighty did not quail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Wherest be thine Hood, shadowy hag?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Mortal Man hast taken it from me unaware.\nWhen I awoke, my Face unmasked,\nMy Kingdom cast into the Light,\nMy Dark King Heirs in Pieces cast,\nAnd here, my Champion smiles.\nYet in truth, thou kept thy Promise truly,\nTo never keep thy Promise true.\"",
        "Hrormir    Son of Hrorgar\nBowed to the Hag, his Queen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"And evermore, \n'Til thou releaseth me, will I serve thee so.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"A clever Mind in a Champion\nIs a much overvalued Trait.\"\nThe Hag released Hrormir's Soul\nAnd he released her Hood.\nAnd so in the Light of darkest Dark,\nShe left Aelfendor evermore.\nAnd after drinking twelve Flagons of Mead,\nAnd bedding four Wenches\nTwice each,\nDid Darfang return to Eversnow\nWith Hrormir\nSon of Hrorgar."
