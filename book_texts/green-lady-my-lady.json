        "Wake, my lady, your day has come\nWe'll dress you in silk\nWeave feathers in your hair\nAnd tie leather slippers on your feet\nCome, my lady, your love awaits\nOn this day, we'll encircle\nA banquet table now filled\nWith tonight's succulent feast\nGreen Lady, my lady, come down\nYour guests now are gathered\nAnd bright, cheerful music plays\nHow blessed are Y'ffre's children!"
