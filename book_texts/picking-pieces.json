        "I'm surprised Quintus was ever allowed to walk the halls of the Imperial Library. If the number of records left in his estate are any indication, he was as delinquent a borrower there as any bank in Cyrodiil. No one came to collect after I sorted out the matter of inheritance, so they're mine now.",
        "* * *\nThere might be more about the Dwemer found in these dusty boxes than anywhere in the world. I could spend years digging through the volumes, but I'm curious about what else Quintus was up to in the months before the expedition to Volenfell.",
        "* * *\nQuintus really was hopeless without me. There's nothing in his notes on the Eye I don't already know. That was my last lead.",
        "* * *\nPoring over months' worth of Quintus's obtuse observations hasn't been a total loss. Before I forced his hand on retrieving the Eye, he was collecting information on another artifact with even more potential to shake up the historical community: The Mad Rock.",
        "* * *\nIt's Wrathstone. Quintus's translation was lazy."
