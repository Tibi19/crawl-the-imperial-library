        "We've settled into Lost Knife, as directed. We just need to push these lazy miners to start producing a bit more ore. Probably have to set a few more examples to motivate them. The rotating hostage tactic is effective for keeping them in line with minimum bloodshed, but it doesn't necessarily make them more productive.",
        "You may want to send someone here to examine an unusual ore that we found. It has some odd properties, possibly magical in nature. It could prove useful. Or valuable. This is not my field of study, though. Send someone with more of a background in alchemy or metallurgy.",
