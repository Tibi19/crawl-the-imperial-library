        "My lover's heart is numbing stone\nThat hides in ice beneath our sight.\nSo some decry, \"It is not there,\"\nWhile others whisper, \"Yet, it might.\"",
        "Though stone is born from fevered ash,\nOnce formed it yields no whiff of heat.\nSo too, her heart betrays no love,\nNor comforts those embracing it.",
        "As mountains grow and yearn for sky,\nThen climbers, conquering, ascend.\nWith chisel, rope, with axe and pick,\nThey force the rock to yield to them.",
        "One peak stands proud amidst the range,\nInvincible, and scaled by none.\nThose men who try wash down her slopes;\nTheir eye-born streams obliquely run.",
        "For brash assault could never pierce\nThose guarded depths that lay apart.\nBut patient water gently shapes\nA furtive channel to the heart.",
        "My love is delving water, ice\nThat cracks with cycles of the sun. \nA lapping, yearning, whispered plea\nWill mark the time 'til I rush in.",
        "For I have dwelt among the rocks,\nMy city carved from rugged stone.\nSo in that burrow I will creep,\nAnd warm the soul which makes my home.",
        ""
