        "To the most illustrious and kind Headman Cosh,",
        "My Headman, I cannot imagine why you have sent to me this day a message of such terse words. I cannot understand why you have sent to me this day a dangerous, poisonous asp.",
        "I am happy to report your jest has been received with good humor. Indeed, the asp only managed to catch the edge of my robe as I dove to the floor. Once I had the creature caged and safe, I laughed and laughed at your bold, keen-edged wit.",
        "If you could, I would like a chance to speak with you about your joke. Any time that is convenient to you is, of course, convenient to your humble servant.",
        "From your fervent and obsequious servant, the grateful Banu."
