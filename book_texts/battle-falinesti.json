        "Beaten at the battle of Sphinxmoth, the Khajiiti commander Eagle Eye ordered his troops into an orderly retreat. Unknown to Eagle Eye, the Bosmer were seeking bloody revenge. As the Khajiiti troops rested somewhere just outside the Vale of Falinesti, the Bosmer set upon them from every side. The battle was short and vicious. Before long, Khajiiti blood filled the vale. The survivors were all butchered and it is said that some were even roasted alive.",
