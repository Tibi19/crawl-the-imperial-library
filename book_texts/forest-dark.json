        "In boots dyed black by dead man's soil,\nI stood upon fear's wheezing threshold\nHidden there, beyond brambles dried\nThe wolf-throats howled and dark boughs sighed\\n\\nOnly once did I stray within\nA fiery youth with a Midyear heart\nAnd hair not yet tussled by death's boney hand\nSoul not yet seared by dread's hot brand",
        "On moss-covered bones and stinkhorn stalks,\nMy feet found frightful, oily purchase\nAnd through the trees swirled fetid murk,\nWhere growling, blood-starved creatures lurked",
        "All around, I heard their breath,\nLike a bow-saw drawn through rain-soaked wood,\nAnd then the howling! That mournful hymn,\nTo the hunt-king Hircine and his murderous whims",
        "I turned and ran through raking thorns,\nA coursed hare's panic upon my eyes\nWith each clumsy stride, the snarling grew\nYellowed fangs set upon flesh to hew.",
        "I burst through the tree line, a ragged thing,\nWith linens tattered and skin flayed deep\nBut the black wolves relented, behind the briars,\nTheir coal-eyes fixed, alight with white fire",
        "\"Flee from here,\" they seemed to say\n\"Back to your hearth and your hollow joys,\n\"But know that we wolves linger still\n\"Return for your last blood-soaked thrill!\""
