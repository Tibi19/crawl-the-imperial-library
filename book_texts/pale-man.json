        "A stranger came upon our hold,\nGhostly for all to behold.\nMute and shivering by our fire,\nWhat conjured a visage so dire,\nA voice so hollow, could barely be heard,\nMurmured warning with just a few words.",
        "The Pale Man comes,\nOn cold wind and dark clouds\nThe Pale Man comes,\nTo snatch away your loved ones\nThe Pale Man comes.",
        "No sooner was the warning sound\nThe first snows touched the ground.\nShrinking from the howling winds\nAnd praying as the sunlight dims.\nWe barred our doors against the night,\nGathered close and huddled tight.",
        "The Pale Man comes,\nWrapped in a cloak of snow\nThe Pale Man comes,\nHis touch will chill you to the bone,\nThe Pale Man comes.",
        "As the frightful storm wore on\nWe stretched out to wait for dawn.\nThere would be no rest\nAwaiting our unwanted guest.\nClutching hard our swords\nAt the clatter of the boards.",
        "The Pale Man comes,\nHe passes like a ghost\nThe Pale Man comes,\nVanishing without a trace.",
        "At last our night did end\nWithout the visitation portend.\nAs our vigilance began to fade\nI turned to where the stranger laid.\nBut they were nowhere to be seen\nNothing remained, just an icy sheen."
