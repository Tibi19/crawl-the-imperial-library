        "Being a swineherd is much harder than you think. Being a good swineherd is even harder. There are many things that a pig needs and it is the duty of the swineherd to see to them all.",
        "A pig needs mud to wallow in, dry hay to sleep in, and clean water to drink and bathe in.",
        "A pig needs slop to eat. Slop can consist of almost any food scraps, but a pig prefers corn cobs, fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, and wheat.",
        "But most of all, a pig needs love. Love your pigs and they will serve you well."
