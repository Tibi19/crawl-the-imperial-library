        "Dear <<1>>,",
        "I pray that this letter reaches you soon. My name is Skaldir - a docent of the Mages Guild. I'm sure you've never heard of me, but I've heard quite a bit about you. My associates tell me that you are a warrior of great renown. I hope you'll give me a hearing.",
        "My fellow scryers and I have made a shocking discovery. Whether it proves to be a boon or a catastrophe remains to be seen. Alas, we do not wield sufficient power to act on our findings. I believe you do.",
        "I humbly beseech you: meet me at the Mages Guildhall in Mournhold as soon as possible. I will tell you everything when you arrive.",
        "Yours in the Sight of Syrabane,\nDocent Skaldir, Associate Scryer of the Order of the Eye"
