        "RE: Defense of Velyn Harbor",
        "Your requests for reassignment to Silvenar for the handfasting ceremony is currently under review, but I cannot emphasize enough the importance of your current assignment, the defense of Velyn Harbor.",
        "The harbor remains the primary port of Malabal Tor and, with the wedding between the Green Lady and the Silvenar imminent, it is imperative that the harbor be kept clear and safe.",
        "The Fists have stationed three full squads in Velyn Harbor, which should be more than enough to fend off any attack small enough to get through the Dominion's blockade.",
        "Do not fail at your assigned duties, Captain, for your ability to choose future assignments is at stake."
