        "Grigerda cursed me for a fool, begged me not to go. But we'll never defeat the Shadowed Path on our own. And none of the alliances will help us; they're too busy killing each other to care about one small town.",
        "It must be done, and I'm the one to do it. The others with me, our strongest warriors, should get me past the creatures of the upper caverns. Once we reach the hidden catacombs, the true struggle begins. The dead that patrol there will not let us pass easily. We must force our way through. Somewhere, deep within the crypts, lies the power that animates these long-dead soldiers.",
        "I know how to appeal to that power, what sacrifice it will require. But for Jafola, who has my heart, and for all of Bruma, I must do it. The dead of Toadstool Hollow will rise again in defense of their land."
