        "Now, while we take all threats seriously, it's difficult to know just how credible this source is. And with everything that's happened as of late, I don't have time to investigate this myself.",

        "That's why I'd like you to head to Arcadia's Cauldron and check their ledger for any suspicious purchases - in particular, poisons. I've asked Arcadia to leave you a copy on her counter. Look it over, find out who purchased bottles over the last few days, and confirm their reasons are legitimate. In the meantime I'll have our cooks check every piece of food, bottle of mead, and leftover bread crumb just to be sure nothing is tainted.",

        "If your investigation turns up nothing, then I'll know the information I received is false, and the Jarl is safe for the time being. If not, I hope someone of your reputation can take care of the situation swiftly."
