        "Brazzefk was once a Dwemer alchemist of great renown. Legend holds that his search for immortality culminated in a potion designed to turn him into a living giant of stone, free from the failings of flesh. The potion worked all too well, turning his entire body into a stuatue, immortal but immobile.",
