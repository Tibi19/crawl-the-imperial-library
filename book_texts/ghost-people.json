        "Our new Argonian guide, Olik-Jaa, is just as frustrating as the last one who led us hither and yon through this dank swamp. Everyday it's some new haunted cave, or sacred mud-flat, or hallowed grove of trees. It's a wonder we can go anywhere in this Eight-forsaken place.",
        "The most recent forbidden region we were told about and not allowed to visit is the \"Veeskhleel-Tzel.\" I think I've spelled that correctly. Black Marsh is chock-full of unpronounceable locations.",
        "According to Olik-Jaa, it's a haunted bog peopled entirely by his ugly frog-faced cousins, the \"Ghost People.\" Apparently, they eat poison toad-hearts so that they can raise the dead or some such nonsense. Oh, and they can also turn invisible and talk to tree roots. I honestly wish I was a storyteller sometimes. The things these lizards come up with really are beyond belief."
