        "Every library holds musty old tales\nCarried through rain and snow\nBut a Nord skald gladly regales\nWhat the poets all sang long ago\nEvery book has its title and name\nBut its pages soon turn to dust\nA poem we sing will live on in fame\nFrom a history all of us trust\nOld tales come down from long ago\nWith inflection and meter and verse\nSoon the skald's audience will hap'ly know\n\"Yes, this life could be worse.\"\nAnd the kings know that truth,\nIs better than sword and shield\nTaught from their distant youth\nSkald Kings have wisdom to wield\nSo welcome me as a friend\nFor the poems I sing tonight\nWill last for nights without end\nFrom first mead to dawn's early light!"
