        "Tooth and claw\nBlood enflamed\nChaos rules\nA race defamed.\nStories lost\nIn history foul\nGenerations lost\nIn a werewolf's howl.\nBut a god's compassion\nAnd a hero's soul\nFought twisting form\nUpon ancient soil.\nThe cause seemed lost\nIn hope so lean\nUntil woman enter'd\nClad all in Green.\nHero and Lady\nAnd god alone\nFought with muscle\nBlood and bone.\nThe race so saved\nFrom bestial ire\nOathbreakers sent\nTo sleep in mire\nHero and Lady\nWill forever last\nJoined together\nBy great handfast."
