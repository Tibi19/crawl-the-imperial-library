        "Day 48:\nToday has to be the day. I've been deckhand for the Rusty Dagger for nearly two months and been tagging along behind the Black Oath for the better part of that. Captain Blackheart must've taken notice of me by now. I almost singlehandedly stormed the deck of that Stros M'kai merchant and slit the throat of the captain myself.",
        "Day 56:\nI saw him up close and by Oblivion he's scary. The stories of Captain Blackheart's hollow stare are not exaggerated. I thought I was ready, but I'm not sure anymore. His crew don't act like the rest of us. They return to the Haven after every voyage and we never see them until the next trip. They must have something special in there.",
        "I am still going to try to get in there and join Blackheart's crew officially.",
        "Day 71:\nI know I impressed him now. Iron Heel came to me last night and told me that the Captain's going to want to see me tomorrow. This is it, my big chance."
