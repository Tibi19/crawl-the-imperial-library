        "I hope this letter finds you well. Think not of the expense, my dear\u2014I care only that you received it in safety. It will be a few more weeks before I am able to break away to visit you again. I know you fear for me. I've a retinue of guards at my disposal, and our excavations are almost complete.",
        "You can't imagine the riches we've uncovered so far. Soon, you will live as a queen, and I your king. Of what? It does not matter. As long as you are by my side, I would rule over a kingdom of dung.",
        "Your ever faithful,\n\u2014 D"
