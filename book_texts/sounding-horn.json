        "Penitent, Stendarr's protection be upon you. Though the Apologist of Men bears a heavy burden, his compassion is still a quality to be admired. Listen to the sounding of the horn. See the blades of the justiciars, and attend the ministrations of charities. These are his expressions, for his atonement.",
        "To complete your venerations here, intone: \"Threefold are the masteries of Stendarr. I sound the horn in his name. May his shield protect me always from harm.\""
