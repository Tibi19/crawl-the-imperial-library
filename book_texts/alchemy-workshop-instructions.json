        "Bring the afflicted to the workshop one by one.",
        "Administer the accelerant. Tell them it's the cure.",
        "Be quick. We need as many afflicted contaminated with accelerant as possible by the time the ritual commences.",
        "When the ritual's magic interacts with the accelerant-infused afflicted, the plague will run its course in minutes instead of weeks. The magic will reverberate so that the circle of power expands quickly, echoing until it infects all of Deshaan as the circle enlarges. The Mistress shall have the army of plague husks she requires.",
        "The Maulborn are her loyal catalysts. We cannot fail."
