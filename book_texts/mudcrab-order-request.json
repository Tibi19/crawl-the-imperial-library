        "The pre-release version of this book was a little different. The last paragraph began instead with \"Not only will you be promoting the culture of Cybiades with your contribution,\" and the author signed his name \"Master Chef He-Cuts-the-Flesh, Cybiades\". By launch, Abah's Landing had instead moved to Hew's Bane.",
        "",
        "Some consider mudcrab to be the food of a commoner--the staple of a peasant. This is truly uninspired on the part of the masses--such a versatile food is as essential to Tamriel as massive wheels of cheese.",
        "As such, I require a barrel of mudcrab meat to be delivered daily so I may develop a compilation of the finest recipes of Abah's Landing for publication.",
        "Not only will you be promoting local culture with your contribution, but I will also provide the typical payment for your services.",
