        "A nereid stole my husband\nMy husband a nereid stole\nBeware the maids of the seastrand\nLest you be the next we console.\nWe strolled blithely along the shore\nGathering shells and turning stones\nWhen came the voice I now deplore\nA voice, a song, such soaring tones!\nAt once, my husband quickly sped\n\"Wait!\" I cried, \"'Tis a nereid!\"\nBut faster still he pressed ahead\nHer sweet call could not be gainsaid.\nToo late, alas, alas, too late\nI found him swaying, deep in thrall\nMy worst fear sent to me by fate\nHe followed the nereid's call.\nAnd she, beautiful, cruel, and vain\nSwam to her sisters, calling this back,\n\"Your husband was no prize to gain;\nHe's yours once more, Lady Crookback!\"\nA nereid stole my husband\nReturning him without delay\nPoor me, near free from his demands\nStuck instead with him since that day!"
