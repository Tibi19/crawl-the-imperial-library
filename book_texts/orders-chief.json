        "Assist the Redguards in their attack on Velyn Harbor. Their plans for invasion do not affect us, and we are being well paid.",
        "Once the harbor is secure, send any you can spare to Jathsogur. The tribes are gathering; they've caught wind of a valuable prize, and our warriors should be there to claim a portion of any spoils.",
        "As for Velyn Harbor, the more damage you can cause, the better! The Aldmeri Dominion think themselves superior to us. We shall show them their folly in not making us their allies when they had the chance!"
