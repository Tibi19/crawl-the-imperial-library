        "My songs are sung in drinking halls\nFrom Winterhold to Daggerfall.\nBuy me some ale! I'll drink it all\nFor I don't sing for free!",
        "The dragons left Nirn long ago\nA tale of vast and cosmic woe\nYou might expect them back, but no,\nThey're all afraid of me!\\n\\nI challenged a titanic Orc\nFor his great blade and priceless torc,\nThen asked if he would taste like pork\nHe dropped his sword to flee!",
        "I met a fair young maiden Elf,\nWho kept my sonnets on a shelf,\nI showed her a few things myself\nNow her kids look like me!",
        "I met a Bosmer on a road\nA vicious freak in mud and woad\nI bellowed like a monstrous toad.\nHe promptly climbed a tree!",
        "I faced a strong young strapping lad\nWho swore I was his long lost Dad\nI must say that is quite too bad\nI swear it wasn't me!",
        "A great Dwemer automaton,\nConfronted me upon a lawn\nI told him where the Dwarves had gone\nThen threw it in the sea!",
        "A Redguard's deadly with a blade,\nThat's curved, like all the swords they've made\nBut they're too dull to cut my braids,\nThey're not as sharp as me!",
        "Through Tamriel, I've fought them all,\nIn darkest caves, by city walls\nNo place is grand as this great hall\nNow have a drink or three!",
        "And raise a mug with me!",
        "Make sure I drink for free!"
