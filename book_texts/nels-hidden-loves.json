        "Haafinger, go!\nThe hilt of a blade.\nJade shadows hide\nMagnificent caves.\nAt western mine\nA long storehouse march.\nDragged across two\nHolds, steady an Arch.\nGreat creature's home,\nWestest of Western.\nNorth frost grotto\nFrigid, sequestered.",
        "Hjaalmarch; A Jarl\nHolds court above all.\nStirring Nord graves.\nA maze of cold walls!\nTowers that lower\nBear weight of great tales.\nFollowing sleep,\nThe seas this one sails.",
        "To Karthald; Turn\nWinds. Watching Jarl's foes.\nFall upon South.\nBrisk breezes freeze toes.",
        "Then to the Dark;\nA dwemer does take.\nEmpty, falls light\nAt waterfall's break.\nSunsets in dark,\nMiners do covet.\nA junk-heap's gem,\nLord Chaurus above it.\nTowers do form\nFrom fungus that grow.\nDeep keep above\nand lava below."
