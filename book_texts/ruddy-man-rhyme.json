        "What does the Ruddy Man like to eat?\nDark Elf eyes and Dark Elf feet!\nDark Elf tongues and Dark Elf toes!\nHide all you want, the Ruddy Man knows!",
        "When is the Ruddy Man out to play?\nWhenever the sky turns dark and gray!\nHe's in that mine, no, he's in that cave,\nHe wants to send you to your grave!",
        "Who can defeat the great Ruddy Man?\nOur Lord Vivec, that's who can!\nHe'll slash and strike the Ruddy Man through\nAnd then he'll make some Ruddy Man stew!"
