        "Per your instructions, I am informing you of strange behavior amongst the Khajiit of the outer city. The one known as Marasadra has been seen praying to the bizarre lion idol out on the banks of the stream. I lack the expertise to determine whether there is any sort of latent sorcery occurring, or whether it poses any sort of threat to us.",
        "The troops want nothing more than to tighten the leash on these cats. If they see anything that might make them nervous, chances are high they will do something unwise and cause grave unrest. It is my opinion, Centurion, that a display of authority is in order.",
        "This concludes my report."
