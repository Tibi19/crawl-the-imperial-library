        "I write to you with sincere regret to inform you, on the behalf of the Office of the Battlereeve, that your husband, Ferlion, has passed away. Your husband died bravely, investigating the disappearances of several persons to the east of Elden Root, near Desiccated Cave.",
        "I want you to know that Ferlion saved every one of those people that day, but was wounded in doing so. He refused to succumb to his injuries until they were safe. Your husband was a paragon of what it means to be a soldier of the Dominion. I hope the fact that he died well can give you some measure of solace in this difficult time.",
        "Regards,\nCaptain Eldiniran"
