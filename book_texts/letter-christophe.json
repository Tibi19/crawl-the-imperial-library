        "After our disagreement a fortnight ago, I feared that business had finally gotten the best of our friendship. Since I still have yet to receive a reply to my last letter, it seems my suspicions are correct. I realize my mistake has cost you a lot and all I hope to do is make amends. I'll be staying at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun should you wish to speak with me.",
