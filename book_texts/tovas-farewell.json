        "First Friga, now Nilsine? How can I bare the loss of a second daughter, when I'm barely over the death of a first?",
        "I simply cannot find any reason to continue living. My two little girls are gone. The lights of my life have been extinguished. My only hope now is to be reunited with them in the halls of Sovngarde - if the eternals can suffer the company of one who has taken her own life. If not, then wherever my soul may end up - in Oblivion, or elsewhere - has to be better than this terrible existence.",
        "Farewell. Remember me fondly, and often.",
