        "T'is not an enviable task to which you have been assigned, but it is most assuredly an honorable one. Once again, our forces have vanquished the Orcs, destroyed their capital, and subjugated their lands. Those who survived have scattered across the region, fleeing back to remote strongholds or journeying to even more distant kingdoms. But rest assured, the day will come when the beasts will return to their homeland and once again try to rebuild their empire. This must not be permitted under any circumstances!",
        "This is why we must maintain an eternal vigil in Wrothgar. Should the Orcs return and attempt to rebuild, you must strike them down immediately. It is my intention that each of you should serve at Watcher's Hold for no more than five years. After this time, I will send new Knights to relieve you of your duty there and you may return home to Daggerfall. Upon this, you have my word.",
        "Thank for your service to crown and country,\nQueen Prolyssa\n10th Hearth Fire 2E 434"
