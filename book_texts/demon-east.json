        "Kingdoms stretch across the sands\nPeace warms our joyful lands,\nA heart that shines through the dark\nWrapped in the threads of time.",
        "A demon rises from the East\nFollowed by a crimson beast,\nOh the earth is torn and scorched\nOur people know but fear now.",
        "A warrior raises sword to the sun\nCalling warriors to follow,\nAlkosh guides threads yet unspun\nHis champion goes forth.",
        "Soldiers come from foreign shores\nTo join us in our dreadful war,\nTaking stride by the warrior's side\nAnd prepare for battle.",
        "Crimson beast nobly bestows\nA horn to defeat his vile foe,\nIts call forces fiends to fall\nVictory seems so close now.",
        "The warrior makes one last stand\nAgainst the dreaded demon,\nIce and blood staining peaceful sands\nNighttime fills the sky.",
        "Chains and spells bind the demon tight\nLocking it away in darkness,\nSoldiers celebrate in new dawn's light\nAnd peace reigns once more."
