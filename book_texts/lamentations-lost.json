        "They said explore Nirn.\nTo many lands I traveled.\nNever feeling like home.\nI worked for a merchant,\nSweeping dusty shops for coin.\nNo respect or wealth.\nI joined a brigade.\nWe saw the horrors of war,\nBlood-dripped battlefields.\nTo an arrow I fell.\nFor greed I died all alone.\nBuried by strangers."
