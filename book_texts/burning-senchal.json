        "Though the sun shines down on me\nThe darkness years ago makes me weep.\nAnd after flames devoured their breath,\nI stood above, mourning all that death.\nWhat then became of me?\nI cannot say.",
        "As the moons shone down on me,\nI chose to follow an ill-made path.\nStaring from a starlit sky,\nMoons' stark radiance witnessed them die.\nWhat then became of me?\nI dare not say.",
        "We must survive, despite the ravages of life, cruel life\nWith its suffering and injustice\nAs death surrounds us.\nBut can we thrive when all hope has fled before us?\nAll that's left is grief and shallow graves.\nThe march of darkness goes on.\nWhat can we do? We just survive.",
        "Decades later who are we,\nAnd after that dire crucible of death?\nDid we pay too high a price\nTo walk away, knowing all we know?\nWhat then became of us?\nNo one should say.",
        "We have survived, despite the ravages of life, cruel life\nWith its suffering and injustice\nWhen death hounded us.\nBut can we thrive after what we paid to get here?\nWho are we now? We dare not say.\nThe march of darkness goes on.\nWhat can we do? What have we become?"
