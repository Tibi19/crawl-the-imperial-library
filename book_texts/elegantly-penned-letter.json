        "Dearest Jibril,",
        "I'm leaving the island. Please don't try to follow me. I will always think fondly of our time together, but we travel different paths.",
        "King Fahara'jad has called for loyal sons and daughters of Alik'r. The Daggerfall Covenant offers a chance to spread beyond the desert, to truly influence world affairs. If he will have me, I will sail with his navy. That is the life I have always dreamed.",
        "You see now why I write you. If you truly care for me, retire from this life. Find an honest occupation. Think of me fondly, but do not pine for what we had.",
        "I will always care for you, Jibril. But if our navy comes upon your ship preying on Covenant vessels, if my captain asks me to put her crew to the sword, I will not hesitate. I will put a sword through you. Honor demands no less.",
        "May you come safely to your journey's end.",
