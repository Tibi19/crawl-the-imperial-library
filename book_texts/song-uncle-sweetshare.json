        "He he! Ha ho!\nTo the workshop he will go!",
        "Uncle Sweetshare is coming near\nTo spread his candy and his cheer!\nIt's better than trinkets, games or toys\nSo say all the little girls and boys!",
        "He he! Ha ho!\nTo the workshop he will go!",
        "Candy, candy -- he makes so much!\nUncle Sweetshare has a magic touch!\nSo it's back to the workshop in the snow!\nWith lovely lanterns all aglow!",
        "He he! Ha ho! He he he ha ha ho!"
