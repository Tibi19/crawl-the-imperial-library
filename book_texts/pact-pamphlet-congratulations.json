        "Librarian Comment:",
        "This book seems to contradict with how slavery was portrayed in Stonefalls and Deshaan. It's mentioned multiple times that House Dres only freed their argonians slaves and turned to khajiit slavery as a compromise with the Pact.",
        "",
        "Now That You're No Longer a Slave\u2026.",
        "By Order of the alliance herein referred to as the Ebonheart Pact, and with the agreement of the ruling bodies of Skyrim, Morrowind, and Black Marsh, let it be known now and forever that slavery has been abolished in all Pact territories and principalities.",
        "Congratulations! You are no longer a slave!",
        "Whether you identify yourself as a Man or Mer, Argonian, Orc, or Khajiit, know and understand that your shackles have been broken and you are a FREE* and INDEPENDENT* being, a citizen of the Pact with all the rights and responsibilities inherent in that singular honor.",
        "So, what now, you're probably asking? What does a person born to slavery suddenly do with his or her newfound freedom? The answer, of course, is \"Whatever you want to!\" That's the beauty of being a free and independent being!",
        "Advisors and counselors will be traveling throughout Morrowind, excluding certain regions* not yet ready to accept the rulings of the Ebonheart Pact, to provide guidance and other assistance to make your transition from slave to free being a simple and painless process.",
        "Welcome to the Pact! We're happy that you're free!",
        "(*The following Great Houses of the Dark Elves have agreed to and will honor this stipulation: Indoril,Hlaalu, and Redoran. Citizenship and freedom are not guaranteed in other Dark Elf territories.)"
