        "The First Day I was to become a Razor Master, to replace the one I helped topple. For me, stepping through the Gate was like falling through a crucible of flame.",
        "It burned deep, boiled my blood, and I crashed out in a field, amidst a shower of molten rock and steam. I don't know how it was that I lived.",
        "I realized I was clutching a dagger in my hand.",
        "\"I have given you a means of defense.\" The voice spoke, but no one was there.",
        "\"This is all?\" I asked the air.",
        "\"That is all you need. Now prove yourself, and live. Or fail, and embrace a new day.\""
