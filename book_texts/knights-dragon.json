        "If you are intent on joining the Knights of the Dragon, you must understand our purpose and our way. Some confuse us with the Dragonguard. We are not devotees to the Empire of Cyrodiil, nor were we created to slay the dragons of old. We were created to serve His Majesty the Dragon, the King of Daggerfall. We are the sword and the shield of Daggerfall's King. We are his elite soldiers, his honorable sons and daughters, and his most loyal protectors.",
        "Say your vows only if you are willing to take on this responsibility. This is our oath:",
        "I vow to serve the Dragon. I lay down my life, my gold, and my sacred honor for my King. His word is my order, my sword is his arm. Our lives are one."
