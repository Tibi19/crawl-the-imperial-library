        "Finally, Archmagister Otheri has let me accompany him to Mzanchend\u2014the great Dwemer ruin that rests under the mine. I would love to discover something really unique.

        "I just need to take in as much knowledge as I can from the Archmagister. I do long to go home to Summerset, but I promised myself I wouldn't until I was more knowledgeable than\u2014well, I should not go down that route again. I'll just sit here and let my magic restore itself.",
        "I will need to find an alchemist though. These machine parts have definitely stained this robe."
