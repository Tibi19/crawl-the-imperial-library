        "Blessed be the name of Stendarr, the God of Mercy.\nHe strengthens and unifies his Resolutes through his wisdom and blessings.\nHe calls us by day to train with sword and shield to strengthen our might; and by night to pray in his name to strengthen our souls.\nHe takes pity upon us, his humble servants, and grants unto us mercy.\nHis holy light of truth will cast out the forces of darkness and rain justice upon Daedric abominations.\nGlory shall be his, forever."
