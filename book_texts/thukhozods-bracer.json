        "Few legends among the Orsimer inspire more respect and fear than the legend of the great Thukhozod. This great and powerful necromancer has been around for generations, apparently ageless and undying. Of course, for every story where an Orc has seen or interacted with the great Thukhozod, there are five more who claim to have explored his lair and seen no sign of the mysterious figure.",
        "Whatever the truth of the legendary necromancer, multiple tales talk about the unique bracer he wears upon his left arm. While not magical, it is said to be beautiful and striking. It would make a great addition to the exhibits in the House of Orsimer Glories."
