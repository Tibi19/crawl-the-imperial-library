        "This place is a wreck.",
        "Orgvar said we'd find treasures down here. He thinks this place must have been an old Dwarven factory or something. Most of us on this venture don't really care whether it was one way or another. We just want to get paid.",
        "Excavating these tunnels is a huge pain in all our arses. So far, we've seen nothing but those eye-smarting crystals that are all over Blackreach and are probably worthless to boot! Not to mention, every tunnel we open up has something waiting to devour us behind it. If it's not the Dwarven security trying to flay us alive, it's a nasty looking bug or some horrifying abomination.",
        "And as if that's not bad enough, Orgvar stinks like a dead skeever rotting in a sewer. I don't think the man's bathed a day in his life! It's maddening down here. There's no air, no escape! It's so unbearably foul. I can't properly describe it with words. You'd have to be here and experience it for yourself. Though, that's a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.",
        "If Orgvar ends up dead, just know that I was justified!",
        "Ugh. Maybe I can sell some of this Dwarven scrap once I get back to the surface. That is, if I make it out of here alive."
