        "You won't believe this. That bumbling Jahadar actually found the skull. It's being held in a cave south of Longhaven. I still can't believe Malangwen managed to lose it just after we took it in the first place. I'm making her come along with me to get it back, with Jahadar to lead the way. If we retrieve it soon enough, we can still follow through with our plan. Meet us as soon as you can, but be careful. Lucretia will be tracking us by now. Let her come. We'll deal with her as soon as we get the skull back.",
