        "Councilor Dolvara,",
        "Thanks to your impressive recommendation, I've been given command of our forces in the Balmora region and promoted to the rank of captain. Remind me that I owe you the next time I can get away from my duties for an hour or two.",
        "I've taken the liberty of reassigning most of the soldiers previously under Ulran's command in order to provide them with a chance to start fresh under the new regime. Only Vatalo Telem's squad remains intact. They were with Ulran on the day of the incident and I want to personally debrief them before I make any sweeping changes. In the meantime, I've sent them to scout the old fort west of Balmora to keep them busy.",
        "Also, I wanted to thank you for reconnecting me with Ferhara and her mercenary unit. I worked with them in the past, but they've been a gods-send for bolstering our presence in contested territory.",
        "Here's the rest of the unit assignments, in case you're interested.",
        "<The rest of the letter contains a list of various soldiers and unit assignments.>"
