        "Old Summerset Folktale, Original Author Unknown",
        "Transcribed by Relicmaster Glenadir",
        "One summer day, a mer bought a rather old scroll from a quaint little shop. She sat down to write a letter to her brother, eager to use her new purchase. But the strangest thing happened as she began to write. Her hand, seeming to move on its own, began to craft a story.",
        "It was wondrous and enchanting. As she wrote she could see the story unfurling behind her eyes, and felt as though was living the adventure within those words. The scroll never seemed to end, forever unraveling but never growing thinner.",
        "And so she wrote and wrote and wrote.",
        "Her brother found her body a few days later. There she laid, her fingers stained with ink, her lips turned up in a smile. And the story she wrote was naught but nonsense, the letters strange and unknown."
