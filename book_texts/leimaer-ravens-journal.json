        "The Konunleikar continues, if such a name could be given to the celebration of a false king. The Stormfist clan participates in this farce so I can deliver my lord's message to the cursed Jorunn \u2026 and so I can see his face as realization sinks in, like a dagger in his heart.",
        "While I would normally find cheating unacceptable, these games have no honor. We must act quickly. I have hidden caches throughout the city. Members of the clan can use the contents against the other competitors.",

        "Behind a cracked henge stone, west and breezy.",
        "At the rear of Windhelm's only abstaining Nord.",
