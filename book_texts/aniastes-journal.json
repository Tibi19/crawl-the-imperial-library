        "I meant to keep a record of observations and experiments on the flora and fauna within Treehenge, but something's taken precedence over research.",
        "The Worm Cult's hunting mammoths. Why, I've yet to determine. But I don't trust necromancers to have altruistic intentions.",
        "Vanendil's asked me to gather as many pieces of ivory as I can carry. He's created an altar on the far side of Treehenge to free the mammoth spirits. I've mostly escaped the notice of the necromancers, but I fear it's just a matter of time before they find the both of us."
