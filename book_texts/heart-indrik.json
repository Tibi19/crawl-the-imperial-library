        "Excerpt from the lecture of Professor Cinutalmo\nTranscribed by Relicmaster Glenadir",
        "Beautiful, isn't it? Though it may resemble a ruby, this stone is actually a crystalized indrik heart. Why, anyone can do it. Just bathe the heart in pure water for a hundred moonlit nights.",
        "Impossible, you say? Not if you move quick enough.",
        "As dazzling as it is, most wouldn't think this crystal capable of malice. And, if untouched, that does hold true. However, once touched by one of an unpure heart, a dark shadow shall blossom within the crystal's center. From then on it will curse all who possess it with such heartbreak that, well let's just say that no one lasts very long after that."
