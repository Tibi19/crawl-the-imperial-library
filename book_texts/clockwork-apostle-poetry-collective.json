        "Forward by Lector Trivura",
        "As an ongoing experiment to strengthen the academic integrity of our younger apostles, an initiative of the abstract concept of \"creative thought\" was undergone. As all calculable results continued to prove inconclusive, the project was deemed unsuccessful after a six-week trial. Here is a selection of the poetry that resulted from this initiative, collected for future analysis.",
        "* * *\nAn Ode to a Factotum",
        "The brass body of your gleaming unit\nThe functions with which you operate\nAll set in a perfect regulation\nWhich you all always gladly state",
        "You clean our streets and sell our wares\nManage our registries and dead\nYou cook our meals and run our banks\nAll these functions in your head!",
        "But from where are you created\nBy our all-knowing Lord Seht?\nWhy can we not enter those chambers?\nDid he lock them and forget?",
        "But we Apostles know the truth\nFor silence gives birth to the intrepid mind\\nMysteries are created to be solved\\nSo I will unlock the riddles of your kind!",
        "* * *\nThe Wrong Numbers",
        "I know that in a fortnight\nThe market's prices will rise\nAnd I know where to go\nTo find the most sturdy supplies",
        "My head is filled with numbers\nBut they're all simply wrong\nThey're prices and people and sales\nI know they don't belong",
        "I should think of the numbers\nThat tell of order and sequence\nBut they refuse to stay for long\nAnd they only make me tense!",
        "I want to be an apostle\nWho can make my family proud\nBut all these wrong numbers\nThey're all that I'm allowed",
        "* * *\nA Soaking Bed",
        "Musty sheets on a soaking bed\nThey smell of mold and oil\nMy sister keeps coughing at night\nI can't help her, I'm useless\nI've always just been useless",
        "Magic gathers in my hands one day\nWarm and bright and filled with hope\nAnd each day I study the machines\nTheir cogs and gears and parts\nI learn their secrets eagerly",
        "I'm finally noticed, I'm finally free\nI enter into the world above\nI study and listen and do as I'm told\nA new name for my new life\nI will walk this path before me",
        "Whispers follow me but I do not listen\nI'm now a stranger in my childhood home\nI know it's selfish not to return\nBut the memories linger of that soaking bed\nOf that endless cough I cannot ease",
