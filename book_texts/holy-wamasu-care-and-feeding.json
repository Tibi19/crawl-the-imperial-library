        "While the holy wamasu will eat anything, a wise keeper ensures a variance in its diet to keep the sacred beast happy and content. When the wamasu is content, the keeper is happy \u2026 and safe.",
        "Do not overfeed the holy wamasu, however! A bloated lightning dragon discharges its excess in several ways. Some are distasteful; others are dangerous.",
        "Experiment with a mix of mud crabs, kagouti, and Bosmer. Remember, the holy wamasu prefers a live diet, so keep its meal both healthy and whole until feeding time."
