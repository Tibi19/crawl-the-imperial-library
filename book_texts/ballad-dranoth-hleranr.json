        "With fearsome claws, Skar did attack\nProtected by his stone hard shell\nThat none could even dent or crack\nBy the beast's might our armies fell",
        "But one brave hero held no fear\nDranoth Hleran, warrior brave\nWith Calderas, his mighty spear\nBut one resounding cry he gave",
        "He raised his spear to the beast\nHe ran, evading every blow\nHis heart was set, his speed increased\nAs he charged the mighty foe",
        "With a final thrust, a final clash\nAt last the mighty Skar was slain\nWith honor gifted to his House\nMay Hleran's glory never wane"
