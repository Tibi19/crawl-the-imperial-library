        "\u2026\nMother made me apologize to the servants today. Why? It wasn't my fault that the soup was served too cold. They should have known and heated it back up to a proper temperature!\n\u2026\nToday I've decided to move into the guest house. I don't need mother to be watching over me constantly.\n\u2026\nMother is being intolerable again! She will not send the servants over to clean up!"
