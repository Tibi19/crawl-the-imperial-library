        "Ingredients",
        "brine\n1 pace-long slaughterfish fillet\nfreshly ground black pepper to taste\n1 cup vinegar\nfire salts",
        "Directions",
        "Soak the slaughterfish fillet in a brine solution for at least 14 hours. Also, submerge the alder wood plank in water, placing a heavy object on top of it to prevent floating.",
        "Prepare an outdoor smoker on deck, filling the heating receptacle with fire salts. Ignite the fire salts using flint and steel and bring to high heat.",
        "Remove the slaughterfish from the brine, rinse thoroughly under cold running fresh water, and pat dry. Remove the wood plank from the water, and lay the fish out on the plank. Season with freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Smoke the slaughterfish for at least 8 hours, checking after 5 1/2 hours for doneness. The fish is done when it flakes with a fork, but it should also not be too salty. As the fish smokes, the salt content reduces. Adjust the cooking time and salty flavor to your taste.",
        "WARNING: Under no circumstances should fire salts be combined with kindlepitch to increase temperature. This is extremely dangerous and can result in injury or death. The chef on the P.N. Coelacanth tried this and she burned to the waterline."
