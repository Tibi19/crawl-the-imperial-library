        "Before the Hist, nothing existed. The Hist meant everything and provided all.",
        "Jaraleet knew this. Every Argonian knew this, instinctively, from hatching. Why, then, wouldn't the Hist speak to them? Didn't the old stories say the Hist talked to its people?",
        "Day after day, Jaraleet burnt offerings and made sacrifices. He chanted and prayed. He ate little, his efforts concentrated upon renewing the ancient connection between the Hist and its people.",
        "One morning, his wife insisted he eat a full meal. \"No matter how much you wish it, you cannot feast upon the Hist itself,\" she gently chided.",
        "Jaraleet blinked as her words pierced his thinking. \"Hist sap!\" he cried, touching his forehead to hers with affection.",
        "Though no alchemist, Jaraleet concocted formula after formula. He distilled various ichors, combining each one in varying amounts with Hist sap, tasting them all, making adjustments. He felt the Hist urge him on, demanding he break through its silence.",
        "Finally, Jaraleet drank his master decoction. He savored the thick, sweet syrup coating his tongue. Standing quietly beneath the Hist's outstretched boughs, his eyes glittered with comprehension.",
        "\"I am your child and servant,\" he whispered. And the Hist showed him all things."
