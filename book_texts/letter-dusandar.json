        "This trip has been a fabulous boon to my tender disposition. I feel recharged and ready to face life in the courts of High Elf society again. Almost.",
        "I've been very productive. I'll have completed at least three landscapes by the time I pack up to return, and I've sketched at least a dozen more that I hope to paint in my - ha! - spare time when I return home.",
        "The view from this overlook, by the way, is simply spectacular. I wish you could see it. Well, I guess you will when you see the finished painting. The moons rising over the ruins of Skyreach. Just breathtaking. I hope my humble skills are enough to capture the essence of the scene.",
        "What am I saying? Of course they are!",
        "Oh, and I got you a present. For that collection of rocks you love so much. It's a local stone with a quaint name. They call it \"red brittle.\"",
