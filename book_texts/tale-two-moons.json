        "As the sky falls white on Elsweyr\nWhen the frost forms on the lake\nWhen the fires blaze in brightness\nWhen old bones begin to ache\nThen cats cast off their budis\nAnd fur keeps out the cold\nAnd small moon chases big moon\nAnd tells him secrets old\nBut then blue skies o'er Elsweyr\nWhen rivers stream with light\nWhen fires die in ashes\nWhen youth again takes flight\nThen cats rewrap their budis\nAnd comb out rich, thick manes\nAnd big moon chases small moon\nAnd frees her from her chains"
