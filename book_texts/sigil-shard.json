        "\u2026These rare artifacts are shards of sigil stones, used to create and hold open Oblivion gates or used as a key to access a gate that has been sealed from the Oblivion side.There is a danger with these shards, as they weaken the walls of reality, opening the potential for a Daedric invasion.If ever such an event were to happen, it is likely that the Daedra would be drawn toward the sigil shard.(where do I put it? in the kitchen\u2014no upstairs, near mother's bedroom)"
