        "Negotiations can be tricky things. Whether you have parties who are already in agreement with one another, or groups who would love nothing more than to rip out each other's throats, navigating talks between them must be orchestrated with care.",
        "No matter if you are an accomplished diplomat or a businessperson, negotiating is an essential skill. Anyone can learn it, but it must be practiced and refined. Here, I will list a few techniques that are invaluable to the skilled negotiator.",
        "Patience! Negotiations can be incredibly frustrating. Maintaining a level head throughout the proceedings, even when others seem to be doing their best to vex you, will undoubtedly help everyone reach an agreement. If you find yourself raising your voice or unable to calm down, you might consider taking a break until such emotions subside.",
        "Make sure you have a comfortable and spacious meeting area. Cramped and disagreeable places tend to foster the same qualities in the negotiations. You want people to feel at ease while broaching the topic under discussion. Make sure it's not too hot wherever you are, as that's bound to increase tensions. If it cannot be helped, make sure to provide cool refreshments.",
        "Ensure that everyone is heard during the meeting. Negotiations are most often snuffed out before they ever get the chance to start because of one group feeling misunderstood or even outright ignored. If you ensure that everyone has time to state their case, and that their words are understood, then your negotiations will run much smoother!"
