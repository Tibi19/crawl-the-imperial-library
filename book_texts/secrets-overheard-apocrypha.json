        "The Seekers pretend that they cannot talk, but they can. For I have heard them. They can both understand speech, and utter it, though they do so with a hissing lisp. I shall tell you how I know.",
        "As is so often the case since I came to Apocrypha, I was cowering behind a stack of books, hiding from the baleful attentions of a towering gill-man whose notice I had inadvertently caught. I listened to hear if I was still gibbering, but I couldn't hear it, which usually means I'm not. Then I heard something else.",
        "Just beyond my concealing tower of tomes was one of those endless halls lined with numberless urns, halls that I have assiduously avoided ever since I learned that each urn houses, in a broth of noisome fluid, a living concept-organ excised from its corpus. I do not like those urns.",
        "From the entrance to this hall of urns came the all-too-familiar squelching sound of a Seeker's footfalls. But then it stopped, and in its place I heard, for the first time, the sticky sound of a speaking Seeker.",
        "\u2014I know a thing, the Seeker lisped, as a frisson of horror danced down my spine.",
        "\u2014Is it a thing worth knowing? came the hollow, sourceless voice of the organ in the hithermost urn.",
        "\u2014You shall judge, Floater. I have learned why we have seen no mortal intruders, save for the demented wizard, in many turns of the Great Pages.",
        "\u2014You know nothing, said the organ.",
        "\u2014I know Old Antecedent has entered into an agreement with the mortals, a compact, as they say. Is that nothing? asked the Seeker.",
        "\u2014Next to nothing. The Golden Eye is always entering into pacts with mortals. Thus my woeful condition.",
        "\u2014Avoid self-pity, or I shall mock you. You do not like it when I mock you. Listen attentively.",
        "\u2014I listen.",
        "\u2014In truth, the Scryer enters into many pacts with mortals\u2014but never before has he made a pact with every mortal on Nirn.",
        "\u2014Bah. Unlikely.",
        "\u2014I state it! It is a thing that is known.",
        "\u2014How?",
        "\u2014I heard a discussion between Scrivener Uu-Thorax and the Eleventh Preceptor. They came into the Crepuscule, where I was quietly\u2026.",
        "\u2014Seeking?",
        "\u2014Yes. In fact. Now, listen: the Scrivener told the Preceptor that the Inevitable Knower had agreed to a pact, to cease all direct interposition in Mundial affairs.",
        "\u2014Impossible. I scoff. Mock me as you will.",
        "\u2014So thought I, and likewise the Preceptor expressed skepticism, but then the Scrivener spoke a Word of Asseveration. Books scattered everywhere, ichor fountained from my ear-holes, and I knew what he said was a Known Thing.",
        "\u2014But why? To meddle with mortals and wrest from them their knowledge is the Ur-Daedra's favorite pastime.",
        "\u2014He seems to have been paid a great price, something he dearly desired, but I could not clearly hear what, due to the injury to my ear-holes.",
        "\u2014It is knowledge, of course. Some great secret. It is ever so.",
        "\u2014So I deem it as well. And it seems this compact binds in both directions, which is why the mortals come here no more, added the Seeker.",
        "\u2014Except for the mad mage. How came he here, and upon what ill errand? asked the urn-organ.",
        "\u2014I know not. But if we catch him, we will pull out his \u2026 what is that sound?",
        "I heard it too, and so I ran. For I knew that sound. It was gibbering."
