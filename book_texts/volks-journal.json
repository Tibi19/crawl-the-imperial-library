        "Day 14\nI knew I should have volunteered for the excavation earlier.  For months, Moric had been going on to the Vigilants about detecting mystical energies deep in the east mountains.  Said he'd found some old tomes about the ruins of \"Ruunvald,\" or something the like, a Nordic chamber thousands of years old.  I remember thinking \"Yeah, if it's so old, how come no one's found it yet?  There's plenty of adventurers wandering around these parts.\"",
