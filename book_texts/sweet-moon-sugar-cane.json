        "(A Khajiiti Working Song)",
        "The Wood Elves have their rotmeth brew\nMade of meat and bile\nThe lizards eat their bugs and twigs\nAnd everything so vile",
        "But those of us who walk the sands\nKnow life's greatest pleasure\nIs strictly sweet, a tasty treat\nIt's moon-sugar that we treasure!",
        "CHORUS\nFields drenched in moonlight\nDewed with summer rain\nBrilliant green and growing tall\nSweet moon-sugar cane!\nSweet moon-sugar cane!",
        "Gifted by the Moons\nAs they wax and wane\nFill our bowls and fill our souls\nSweet moon-sugar cane!\nSweet moon-sugar cane!",
        "We sprinkle it on fine steak\nGlistening so sweetly\nWe smear it on our salmon\nAnd gobble it up completely",
        "We bake it into our sweet treats\nDon't you want a taste?\nSo eat it quick and wash it down\nBecause nothing shall go to waste",
        "CHORUS\nFields drenched in moonlight\nDewed with summer rain\nBrilliant green and growing tall\nSweet moon-sugar cane!\nSweet moon-sugar cane!",
        "Gifted by the Moons",
        "As they wax and wane\nFill our bowls and fill our souls\nSweet moon-sugar cane!\nSweet moon-sugar cane!"
