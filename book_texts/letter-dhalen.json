        "You shall be greatly rewarded for your efforts at Fort Amol, my servant. It pleases me to hear that the alchemical elixirs you discovered in the Daedric ruins have proven to be so useful.

No one deserves such a fate more than my beloved, conniving, cheating, too-smart-for-his-own-good brother Jorunn.\nWhen everything has been dealt with, meet me at Skuldafn. We have one last thing to deal with before I can reclaim my kingdom.",
